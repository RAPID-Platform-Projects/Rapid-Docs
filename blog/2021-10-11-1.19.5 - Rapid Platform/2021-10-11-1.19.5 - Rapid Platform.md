# 1.19.5 - Item Action Buttons
11/10/2021

## Features

### Action Buttons on Items

It is now possible to configure custom action buttons on items in the command bar. These actions include existing menu support to open pages and custom links as well as to trigger custom server endpoints (such as Flows).

For example, you can now configure a custom Delete action that triggers a Flow which can then delete both the clicked item and all linked items to make ‘bulk’ administration easier.
For support in creating and designing your custom actions please contact your representative.

### Workflow v2 Input Support

Workflow v2 Diagrams can now support Inputs and Outputs both for manually started processes as well as Call Activities. These inputs can be referenced within processes using both adaptive expressions and directly on conditional gateways.

This allows for the creation of processes that can understand the context they are being triggered from without needing to use signal events. As you start building input driven processes, try executing a process manually form within Explorer for that extra ‘on demand’ convenience.

### Workflow v2 Test Plans

For those wanting to ensure their processes keep doing what they expect you can now create test plans for v2 diagrams. Test plans run in a sandbox environment that will not affect anything outside the test. Tests cannot trigger webhooks, create or edit items and cause any other permanent side-effect. 

When writing a test plan you provide what external information you expect to occur within the test letting you test different scenarios quickly and easily. Test plans are saved making re-testing changes to existing workflows quicker and easier.

### Bundles v2

Bundle support has been overhauled to now support zipped files, which can include table, menu and PowerBI report items to be imported. Extracting a bundle will now generate in the new format. The library of existing bundles have also been updated to conform to the new structure.
