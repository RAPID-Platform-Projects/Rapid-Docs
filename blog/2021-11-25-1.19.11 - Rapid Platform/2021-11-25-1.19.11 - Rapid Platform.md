# 1.19.11 - General Usability
25/11/2021

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed regression where a template file is unable to be selected in Workflow
- Fixed the recursive link items to respect if a parent item is deleted and then not recurse down in Explorer
- Fixed placeholder permissions not being applied correctly when an inherited user field is created
- Fixed a rare issue where inherited types may not be fetched in LinkedTo context if they are linked through a multi-lookup

## UI/UX Fixes

- Fixed minor UI issue with parallel gateways in Workflow
- Changed the diagram filtering in Workflow to be case insensitive
- Added Icons to update notes in the activity feed
- Prevented a tooltip hover covering the close action button on certain field types in Designer
- Removed a field configuration option for choice type from unrelated fields in the properties pane of a field in Designer
- Added icons and title for the Adaptive system list

## Improvements

- Added routes to allow users to create and access database views
- This change is fundamental to the Reporting experience which relies on giving the ability for users to create their own views which they can then use in their reporting
