# 1.20.1 - Anonymous Forms
15/01/2022

## Features

### Anonymous Forms
You can now create publicly accessible forms via Workflow. An anonymous form has a unique URL that you can send to a 3rd party to fill in. When they submit the form it will then complete the form task which allows your processes to wait until it is completed before moving on. Completed forms will then prevent a person from submitting that form again.

You can also create anonymous forms ad-hoc by creating a form task. This will generate the unique URL within the task automatically. Ad-hoc form tasks can also be flagged as persistent which will prevent the task from being completed on submission, so that you can send the same form to multiple people.
