# 1.21.1 - Fill in the Blank (Adaptive Designer)
09/03/2022

## Features

### Fill in the Blank Component

Added the following component into the Adaptive Designer. It allows for another way of entering data. The intended use for the fill in the blank component is when a form designer wants to make a questionnaire where the inputted answers will be within a block of text. The Fill in the blank component supports all field inputs along with the static text component.

## Bug Fixes 

- Fixed adding preconfigured fields to a form through the context menu

## UI/UX Fixes

- Added the ability to select base entity fields when an inherited list is selected
- Lookups no longer show an ID in Anonymous forms
- Added the ability to clear attribute and style fields in Designer
- In Designer, made user fields read only
- Now able to set an icon and custom label on a submit button
