# 1.22.2 - RAPID Meetings
24/03/2022

## Features

### RAPID Meetings

It is now possible to create manage and sync meetings and meeting events through RAPID. Installing the created Meeting bundle onto your site will give you access to this new feature. A key feature of Meetings is that it will sync with outlook. It will create outlook events and keep them synced to the meeting items in RAPID.

### Date Time Field Configuration

When configuring page definitions in RAPID Designer, it is now possible to specify on the attributes of a date time field for time to be configurable. This will allow for a specific time to be saved to an item when viewing the field on the particular page that has time enabled on the field. This time field uses the user's chrome locale so ensuring it is set correctly is important.
