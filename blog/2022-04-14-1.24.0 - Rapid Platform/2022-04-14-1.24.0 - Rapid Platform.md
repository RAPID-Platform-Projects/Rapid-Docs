- Fixed crash on sections when using show conditions on children elements
- Updated flip card control to show children elements correctly

## UI/UX Fixes

- Updated flip card control to show configuration panel correctly
- Updated icon for flip card control
- Updated boolean controls to new skinny switch

## Improvements

- Upgraded Carousel control to work with data connections
- Enabled overriding of default data context when using pre-fill data
