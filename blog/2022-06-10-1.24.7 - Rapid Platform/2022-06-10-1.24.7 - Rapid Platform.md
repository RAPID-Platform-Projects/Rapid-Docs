# 1.24.7 - Adaptive Designer Performance Overhaul
10/06/2022

## Features

### Sharepoint Permission Sync

When creating or editing an item with a drive and folder set, the same permissions applied to the item will be applied to that item's folder in sharepoint. This ensures that an item's permissions will be the same as the file permissions.

## UI/UX Fixes

- Added ability to disable create button for current list on data tables in Explorer
- Fixed lookups in public forms displaying '0' when unset
- Locale is now set correctly when exporting CSV from data table in Explorer

## Improvements

- Overhaul of Adaptive Designer and the Adaptive Renderer which results in major performance benefits. Render and load times are dramatically decreased
