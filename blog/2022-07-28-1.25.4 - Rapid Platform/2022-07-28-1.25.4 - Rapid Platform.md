# 1.25.4 - Adaptive Scheduler
28/07/2022

## Features 

### Added the scheduler Control

Adds the DHX scheduler to Adaptive Designer. Currently this control is in preview mode and was built specifically around providing a booking system. There are more generic uses for this control and these will be more explicitly supported as time goes on. 

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the sharepoint permission call can fail in certain cases
- Fixed an issue where a timeout occurs on save when all permissions are cleared from an item

## UI/UX Fixes

- Added the ability to set number of default sections in a repeating section
- Added the ability to configure multilookup parent connections
