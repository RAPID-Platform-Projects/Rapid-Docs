# 1.25.14 - API Updates
6/10/2022

## Features

### Default configuration for Date columns on lists

You can now configure a date column in Designer to have a default value. This value is configured as a combination of a relative date plus an offset. For example, Task Start Dates now default to Today, while their Due Date now default to Today +1 (aka: Tommorrow).

The list of relative dates to use mirror the configuration for Views and are

- today
- tomorrow
- startOfWeek
- endOfWeek
- startOfMonth
- endOfMonth
- startOfQuarter
- endOfQuarter

As always at RAPID we are looking for feedback on which relative dates you would find useful.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed itemFilter configuration failing to be regarded in public forms for child repeating sections
- Fixed Prefill data for root level single item contexts being nested under _data._data
- Removed dead Workflow v2 API routes
- Removed dead Workflow v2 test plan routes and UI

## Improvements

- Added $top and $skip independent query parameter support to Omnichannel when fetching a calendarView, previously both keys were required to be processed
- Added scroll to connections panel in Adaptive Designer for tables with more than 30 columns
- The Get Items service task now regards the selected view, instead of defaulting to the All$ view
