# 1.26.7 - Adaptive Documents
27/11/2022

This release replaces Adaptive Forms with the more flexible Adaptive Documents. Documents are powerful way to store and track deep data in a single, transmittable form. This change paves the way for Adaptive Apps to develop custom experiences.

As a consequence of this change, Adaptive Designer has been upgraded to support Documents. Additionally this release will include a database upgrade to shift all existing forms into documents. 

## Features

### Adaptive Designer v3

Designer has undergone significant changes supporting documents. You can now open multiple documents at the same time to make switching between them easier.

Tab support has also been added to help spread configuration out so you can focus on what you're trying to do.
