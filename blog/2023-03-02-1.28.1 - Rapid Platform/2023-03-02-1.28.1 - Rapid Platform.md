# 1.28.1 - Styling and Cleanup
2/3/2023

## Features

### DocX PDF Support

You can now generate a PDF from the DocX service task. When creating a PDF file the original word file will still be produced. When referencing the embedded files configuration of the DocX service task in Workflow with PDF selected, the PDF file will be returned instead.

Additionally there is now a toggle to preserve the `{moustache glyphs}` within your documents when running the service task. By default these glyphs will now be replaced with a blank character.

## Bugfixs

- Fixed a page crash when navigating between the login page and task list in the Tasks Experience
- Fixed conditions in repeating sections failing to evaluate
- Fixed subtypes of items linked via lookup failing to be fetched in linked scenarios

## Improvements

- Repeating sections in Adaptive now fetch all fields contained within them, including multi-line text fields
- Added Theme.css file support to the Tasks experience
- Added search when using @mentions in the Activity Feed for sites with more than 250 users
- Added click-through support between Explorer and Workflow when opening process runs inside call activity scopes
- Added new custom rich text editor to Adapative, replacing the Multi-Line Text Control
