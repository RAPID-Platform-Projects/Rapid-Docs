# 1.30.6 - Workflow Improvements
11/5/2023

## Features

### Update Associations

With the advent of Cans you can now configure the Data Association (dotted arrow) from an Activity towards a Can to set values of the associated item. This update is performed after the action is completed, so that you can capture data collected during the activity itself.

### Authenticated Service Tasks

Webhook service tasks can now use Basic authentication when interacting with remote APIs. This authentication is created and stored in a newly updated Rapid Integrations list. When creating a new integration the Username and Password are stored securely in Azure Key Vault and not on your site. As a consequence you will not be able to see stored passwords. Updating a Username or Password will overwrite the value in the Key Vault and thus be used by Workflow form then on.

### Lookup View Whitelisting

When configuring a Lookup component in Adaptive Pages and Forms, you can now select a subset of views on the target table to present to the User. By default the All view will still be the first selected view.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed Default values for Choice fields in Adaptive Pages and Forms failing to load
- Fixed long placeholder and content values of Choice fields extending out the page
- Fixed deleted RAPID Sites persisting in cache storage

## Improvements

- Disabled Save and Complete buttons on Tasks while saving/completing
