# 1.30.7 - Authenticated Requests
18/5/2023

## Features

### API Key Requests

With the positive feedback from last weeks Authenticated requests from Workflow Service Tasks, we have also added API key support. API Keys still are powered by RAPID Integrations on your site and can be configured in several ways depending on how your target API would prefer to receive its keys.

#### Custom Header
CUSTOM_KEY = "X-API-KEY"

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
[CUSTOM_KEY]:  [Your Integration Key]
```

#### Basic Authentication
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization:  Basic [Your Integration Key]
```

#### Query String
CUSTOM_KEY = "apiKEY"

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Params:  {
    [CUSTOM_KEY]: [Your Integration Key]
}
```

#### Body Parameter
CUSTOM_KEY = "API-KEY"

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Body:  {
    [CUSTOM_KEY]: [Your Integration Key]
}
```

### Adaptive Cascading Lookups

You can now configure cascading lookups in Adaptive documents. Cascading lookups regard another lookup on the document and once configured with a matching criteria will filter the items fetched by that criteria, just like in Explorer. 

This support should be live for both Tasks and Public form.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed creating RAPID Integrations with a Username failing to save on first create

## Improvements

- User Tasks in Workflow will now return their entire item profile on creation, rather than just completion
