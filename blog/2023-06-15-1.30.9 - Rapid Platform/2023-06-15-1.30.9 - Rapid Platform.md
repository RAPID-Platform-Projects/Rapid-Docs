# 1.30.9 - Form Submission Custom Pages
15/06/2023

## Features

### Successful Submission Form

It is now possible to configure a form or page to be shown in form service after the submission of a form. This is configured on a form level, where successful or errored submissions of the form can have a custom page shown rather than the default success/fail pages.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where lists fail to delete due to foreign key constraints
- Fixed a page crash in forms service when a lookup is prefilled to null
- Fixed a crash when typing 2 characters at once in a multi line field with a default value set
- Fixed an issue where repeating sections will submit null when containing a default value

## Improvements

- Priority and all other required fields will now be fetched for the tasks experience
- Resolved an issue where an erroneous error is thrown on creation of a folder
- It is now possible to compare 2 columns together in an OData Filter
- When creating or updating a view with an invalid request, no longer times out but returns error
- Inactive users will no longer attempt to have SharePoint permissions synced to
