# 1.30.11 - SendGrid support in User Tasks
6/07/2023

## Features

### User Task Communication Support

You can now leverage the existing communication infrastructure in User Tasks when configuring your Workflows. This currently only supports SendGrid but will naturally extend to more communication channels as they become available.

### Embedded File Control

Added the embedded file control to Adaptive. This allows custom pages to render an embedded file definition and allow file viewing and uploading.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed Adaptive Designer overview page failing to populate on refresh
- Added more robust error handling and reporting when Data Cans run into problems
- Fixed Embedded Files configuration being destroyed by update item menu actions
- Fixed dependant lookup construction failing when regarding filters on base tables for sub-types
- Updated the Due Date for tasks generated in a loop to regard now, rather than the start of the loop

## Improvements

- Added exit intent configuration on all Explorer menu buttons
- Added Embedded Files control to Adaptive control library
- Added environment variables to webhooks and remote actions in Explorer
