# 1.30.14 - Folder Templates
31/08/2023

## Features

### Folder Templates

Through Designer, it is possible to now configure a folder to use as a template for a particular list. If configured, when creating an item when the 'always create folder is enabled', the contents of the folder will be set on that item. For existing items, the folder will be cloned when creating a new folder for the item through the UI.

### URL Parameter for universallyLinkedTo

Like the LinkedTo param, putting this in a get Items request from RAPID will return any items for the specified list that are universally link to the specified item, this will not return scoped universal links.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where lists cannot be deleted due to since deleted lookup fields
- Prevented page crash on Workflow when viewing malformed sequence flows
- Fixed files component in Public Forms failing to upload a file when within a child connection

## Improvements

- Added a suite of Workflow Integration tests
- Added the IN Odata query operator, using the following syntax `IN(column name,value1,value2)`
- Added toggle on Perform Remote Action menu items to send a batch request instead of individuals
- Added default filter to Adaptive Designer when selecting a document to not regard apps
- Hide the execute diagram button if a non-executable diagram is opened
- Improved UI for configuring cascading lookups
- Cascading lookups now use OData filters
