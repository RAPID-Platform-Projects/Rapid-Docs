# 1.35.0 - Rapid Platform

08/02/2024

## Features
### 1. Hide View selection panel from a Lookup / Multi-lookup in Explorer

This feature relates to Lookup / Multi-Lookup column types and Table Views.

Lookups / Multi-Lookups are special types of columns. Not only they link tables with each other, at the user level (in Explorer), they provide the ability to:
1) View all data of linked fields
2) Select any data from linked fields

This is made possible by the ability to select / change Views while selecting a Lookup / Multi-Lookup value.

This can be a double edged sword. 

For example - a Projects Item has a field - "Client". Client is a Lookup on "Contacts" Table which stores the information of all contacts for the organisation.

Clicking on the Lookup - Client field, the list of Contacts open in a dropdown. The right side provides the ability to change the view.

Although the field was meant to select a customer, a User can also view information on Suppliers / All contacts of the organisation. This can a potential threat to confidentiality. 

:::info[New Feature]
This new feature provides you with the ability to hide the View selection panel.  
If the feature is set to hide the View selection panel, the user will only see results as per the default View set / Item Filter configured in Designer.  
The user (in Explorer) would not be able to change the View and cannot access information from other Views.  
:::

**How to hide/show Views in Lookup / Multi-Lookup**

Please consider the following steps:

1. In Designer, go to your desired Table (where the subject Lookup / Multi-Lookup field is present)  
2. Go to Columns Tab
3. Select the subject Lookup / Multi-Lookup field.

4. Notice a new checkbox - "Toggle Side Panel Visibility"

  If this field is:

  a) Checked - it means the Side Panel to select / change Views will be absent
  b) Unchecked - it means the Side Panel to select / change Views will be present

:::tip[Please note]
1) If you have set the default view and checked the "Toggle Side Panel Visibility" then the Lookup / Multi-lookup will show only the values as per the set default View.

2) If no default View is mentioned on the system will take the "All" View as default and Lookup / Multi-lookup will show all values.

3) If an Item Filter is set then the set rule will take precedence over the default View and the values in the Lookup / Multi-Lookup will be appear accordingly.

4) The checkbox - Toggle Side Panel Visibility can be set while creating a Column as well.
