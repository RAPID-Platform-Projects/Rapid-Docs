# 1.36.0 - Rapid Platform

22/02/2024

## Features

### Bulk Update via Data Associations

You can now update a collection of items with the same value in Workflow!
Bulk update support is achieved via the Data Association element, just like single update and creation.

For example:
![Example Project Setup Process](<Example Diagram.png>)

Say you had a process for formally setting up a project, along with all the tasks. As part of this process is an approval stage. If the project wasn't approved it would be pretty tedious to shut down all the tasks. 

![Example Data Association Configuration](<Example Data Configuration.png>)

Instead you can now use a data association to update a Data Can that fetches many items, which will then set the chosen values for each of them. Here we use the can to select all the tasks associated with the project, then set their status to Aborted to cleanly shut them down.
