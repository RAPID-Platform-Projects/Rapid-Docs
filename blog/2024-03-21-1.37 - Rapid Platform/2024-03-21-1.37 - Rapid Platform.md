# 1.37.0 - Rapid Platform

21/03/2024

## Features

### Modular Rapid

You can now group up tables, menus and pages into logical units we call [Modules](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/docs/Rapid/Keyper%20Manual/Designer/Advanced/modules/). These modules can be toggled on/off to give more complete control over your site.

You can read up on how to create and manage modules [here](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/docs/Rapid/Keyper%20Manual/Designer/Advanced/modules/).

### New and Improved Notifications interface 

This release brings out an improvement how the [notifications](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/docs/Rapid/User%20Manual/Explorer/Notifications/) appear in Explorer. 

The new notifications interface makes it easier to pickup the mentions and reminders from the remaining list. Prior to this release, there were no visual alerts in Explorer to notify the unread notifications. One had to access the notifications area to view the list of unread ones.

The new notification interface will show both the header and the body (without truncating it) in the notification list itself. This brings ease of viewing the notification and reduces the time to assimilate the message.
