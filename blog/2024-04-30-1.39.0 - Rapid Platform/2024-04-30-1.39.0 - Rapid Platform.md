# 1.39.0 - Rapid Platform

30/04/2024

## Features
System Settings Table
While creating reports in Rapid Platform, it is not an uncommon to be want to create links to items within the report. You can now dynamically generate these links to regard the site they come from using the new Settings table. This table holds configuration information about the site itself, such as its identity.

**The problem**
To link an item in a report, a URL is required. This URL to the item has the title of the Tenant and Site.

Previously this would need to be baked into the reports themselves as the site was not aware of its own identity.

This notably failed in reporting scenarios that spanned multiple sites, or product reports that are deployed dynamically to customer sites.

**The solution - "Settings" Table**
In release v1.39, there is a new system list created with the title - "Settings". This Settings table has two columns - Title and Value.

This table stores the following about the subject site:

1. The Site Title
2. The Site ID
3. The Tenant Title
4. The Tenant ID
5. The Environment

Using the Settings Table, the problem is addressed. The title and id of the site is now stored in the system and hence is accessible by the report for creating links.

**Using Settings in PowerBI**

Settings is just a normal list as far as loading its data into your PowerBI reports. If you're interested in getting started straight away, here is a simple way to start generating dynamic links:

1. Load the settings table into your data model directly grabbing the Site and Tenant values

2. These are single row values, so use a measure to flatten the value into a scalar string for easy future referencing using the `MAXX` function

3. Setup the link URL using the values from the scalar Site and Tenant values you've created, the concatenation `&` operator makes this nice and easy

### Process Clean up

Processes frequently rely on certain items for the process to make sense. When a process run is triggered from a signal event the triggering item is now flagged as important to that process run. With this new feature, deletion of the important item will now abort the associated process(es). This is an early feature exploring automated clean-up. Any feedback on what you expect, how it behaves and what you imagine it working would be greatly appreciated.

### Conditionally Enabled Menus

Menu actions on items are quite powerful. There are times where depending on the state of your item an action doesn't make sense to be used. You can now handle these cases by using the new condition configuration on menu items.
