# 1.39.0 - Rapid Platform

30/04/2024

## Features
System Settings Table
While creating reports in Rapid Platform, it is not an uncommon to be want to create links to items within the report. You can now dynamically generate these links to regard the site they come from using the new Settings table. This table holds configuration information about the site itself, such as its identity.

**The problem**
To link an item in a report, a URL is required. This URL to the item has the title of the Tenant and Site.

Previously this would need to be baked into the reports themselves as the site was not aware of its own identity.

This notably failed in reporting scenarios that spanned multiple sites, or product reports that are deployed dynamically to customer sites.

**The solution - "Settings" Table**
In release v1.39, there is a new system list created with the title - "Settings". This Settings table has two columns - Title and Value.

This table stores the following about the subject site:

1. The Site Title
2. The Site ID
3. The Tenant Title
4. The Tenant ID
5. The Environment

Using the Settings Table, the problem is addressed. The title and id of the site is now stored in the system and hence is accessible by the report for creating links.

**Using Settings in PowerBI**

Settings is just a normal list as far as loading its data into your PowerBI reports. If you're interested in getting started straight away, here is a simple way to start generating dynamic links:

1. Load the settings table into your data model directly grabbing the Site and Tenant values

2. These are single row values, so use a measure to flatten the value into a scalar string for easy future referencing using the `MAXX` function

3. Setup the link URL using the values from the scalar Site and Tenant values you've created, the concatenation `&` operator makes this nice and easy

### Process Clean up

Processes frequently rely on certain items for the process to make sense. When a process run is triggered from a signal event the triggering item is now flagged as important to that process run. With this new feature, deletion of the important item will now abort the associated process(es). This is an early feature exploring automated clean-up. Any feedback on what you expect, how it behaves and what you imagine it working would be greatly appreciated.

### Conditionally Enabled Menus

Menu items can be configured to perform specific actions like triggering a workflow, opening an adaptive document, sending an email etc. 

There can be occasions when the defined action is eligible based upon a certain condition. 

For example - consider a menu button is configured to trigger a workflow - to "wrap-up the project". This process involves sending out a _thankyou_ emails to all stakeholders, checking for any pending  deliverables, unpaid invoices, release of resources etc. 

A project wrap-up is only eligible for projects having status - "completed and ready for wrap-up". Imagine an employee (by mistake) clicks the "wrap-up project" button for an "in progress" project. This can cause anxiety and frustration among stakeholders, along with data changes that may be difficult to manage. 

You can now enable / disable the menu button based on specific conditions. 

***Steps to conditionally enable a menu***

1. Navigate to your desired table in Designer.
2. Goto the Menu tab.
3. There is a field titled - "Conditionally Enable".

:::info[Please note]
The Conditionally Enable field is visible when the location to display is either "Both" or "Item". This field will not be visible if the location to display of the menu is set as "Table".

![Image showing field to configure condition visible / invisible based on location of menu selected ](<Conditionally enable 1.png>)

This is because, the functionality to enable / disable menu button checks for the condition at the item level. It does not hold any meaning at the list level.

With reference to behaviour of enable / disable of menu button's location on List / Item pages, please consider the following:  

1. If the location to display is set as "Both" AND there is a condition specified in the "Conditionally Enable", then the subject menu button will always be ***disabled*** for the List page. It will be enabled or disabled on the item page based on whether the condition is met or not. 

2. If the location to display is set as "Item" AND condition is specified in the field, then the menu button will be enabled / disabled based on whether the condition is met or not. 

3. If the location to display is set as "Table", you cannot specify the condition as the field "Conditionally Enable" will not be visible in Designer.

4. If the location to display is set as "Both" OR "Item" AND there the "Conditionally Enable" field is left blank, then the menu button will always appear as enabled on both List Page and Item Page (if location as Both) and Item Page (if location as Item).  
:::

5. Provide the condition in the field. Please note, the syntax for the condition is OData $filter query v2.0. At a fundamental level, there are three elements to the OData $filter query  
   a. the column name as variable. For example - project_status.  
   b. the operator. For example - eq (stands for equals).   
   c. the value to be operated against. For example - 'Completed and ready for Wrap-up' (the string value needs to be provided in single quotes)  

![Image showing OData syntax in field to specify condition](<Conditionally enable 2.png>)

6. Click Save.

***Output in Explorer***

The menu button is enabled on the item page when the specified condition is met.

The menu button is disabled on the item page when the specified condition is not met.
