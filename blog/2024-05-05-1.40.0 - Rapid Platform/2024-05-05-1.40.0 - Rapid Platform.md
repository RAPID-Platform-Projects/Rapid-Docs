# 1.40.0 - Rapid Platform

05/05/2024

## Features
### Unification of Attachments and Embedded files components as Attachments component

Prior to this release (v1.40), the Rapid Platform has two components which the users could use to attach files against table items. These components were:
1. Embedded Files
2. Attachments

Although, both the components principally served the same functionality of attaching files against items; however, there were finer differences in functionalities offered by the two components. 

Post release v1.40, all the functionalities of Embedded Files and Attachments are merged together under the title Attachments.

Under Attachments, we now have:
1. Attachment File Bar (the parallel to Embedded files)
2. Attachments component

#### Attachments in Designer

**No more Embedded Files component in Designer**

The Embedded Files component can no more be seen in the Components list. The Attachments component can be added, as normal.

:::warning[Please note]  
The Attachments component added from the "Add a component" panel  displays the list of attached files in Explorer. This may not be visible to the users in Explorer, if there are no files attached.

The users in Explorer cannot add files to the Attachments component until the Attachment File bar is enabled from the Tab Strip and the first file is uploaded there.

**Relationship with Files Browser component**

As soon as the first file is added as attachment to the item, an "Attachments" folder is created in the defined SharePoint directory of the item. 

This can be accessed through the Files Browser in the Files Tab of the Item. 

The "Attachments" folder will have all the files uploaded to the SharePoint automatically.
