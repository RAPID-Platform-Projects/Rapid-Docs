# 1.44.0 - Rapid Platform

## Feature

### Introduction of Cascading Lookups in Adaptive V3

This new release introduces cascading lookups in Adaptive V3, allowing selections to dynamically filter related options. This ensures a more streamlined and efficient user experience with relevant data choices.

**The concept of Cascading Lookups**  

Cascading fields concept involves setting up a pair of fields - can be called as ***Primary*** and ***Dependent***. The value of the _Primary_ field dictates the possible values for the _Dependent_ field. 

Extend this concept to a pair of lookups ie. both _Primary_ and _Dependent_ fields are a lookup type of control. Therefore, the _Primary lookup_ will have a list of values. Based on what the user selects in the _Primary lookup_, the _Dependent lookup_ will present a filtered list available for selection.


**Scenario**

Imagine  a WHS manager is trying to select a WHS representative from each department. The manager faces difficulty navigating a long, unfiltered employee list. 

The manager now uses cascading lookups and sets up **Departments** as the primary lookup and **Employees** as the dependent lookup. With cascading lookups, selecting the department first filters the employee list, making it easy to choose the correct representative quickly and efficiently.

:::info[Cascading Lookup logic]  
 Step 1 - Show values of Column A from Table P (defined as Primary Lookup).  
 Step 2 - Let the user select an item.  
 Step 3 - For the item selected by user, take the value of Column B of Table P.  
 Step 4 - Equate the value obtained in Step 3 with Column C of Table D (defined as Dependent Lookup). Get all the items which match this criteria.   
 Step 5 - Show values of Column D from Table P for all items from Step 4.  
 
 Therefore, to set up Cascading Lookups we need to define:  
 Table P  
  - Column A and 
  - Column B  

Table D  
  - Column C and 
 - Column D  

:::  

**Setting up the Cascading Lookups in Adaptive V3 Designer**

We shall attempt to configure the above scenario in Adaptive V3 Designer.

To configure the cascading lookups, add two lookup controls to your canvas. For ease of explanation we name them as Primary and Dependent.

Set up the Primary Lookup as normal. Select the Table ***Departments*** as Lookup List and its column - ***Name*** as Lookup field. As per the normal behaviour of the control, this tells the system the table and column from where the values need to be displayed in the dropdown of the lookup. Therefore, in the Primary Lookup, the names of all the Departments will be displayed.

Similarly set up Dependent Lookup to show Full Name from Employees table.

Observe the above image, every lookup control now has a **new section in the Element Configuration Panel - Cascading**.

This section allows you to define the attributes that converts two separate lookup elements into a pair of cascading lookups.

The Cascading section in the Element Configuration Panel should be filled only for the Dependent lookup. 

![Image showing fields of cascading section](Cascading_2.jpeg)

The Cascading section has the following fields:

1. Select Element - This is a dropdown field which will display titles of all the Lookup type of controls present on the Canvas. Select the Lookup element that you wish to set as Primary Lookup.

2. To Field - Once the Primary Lookup element is selected, this field will display the list of the columns of the table set in Primary lookup. Select the column of the Primary Lookup against which you wish to equate the value.

3. From Field - This field displays the list of all columns for the table set in Dependent lookup. Select the column with which you wish to equate the value of Primary Lookup.

This completes the simple set up of the cascading lookups.

Lets look at the behaviour of our Cascading Lookup as configured above:

1. The Primary lookup shows the names of all the Departments.

2. Based on a Department selection, the Dependent Lookup shows a list of Employee Names that belong to the department selected in Primary.

3. Change the Department in Primary and the list of employees change in Dependent Lookup as well.

**Custom configuration** 

A single lookup field can also be configured to show filtered values. Observe this field in the Cascading section of the Element Configuration Panel.

The discussion so far was oriented towards the configuration with Element

![Image showing element fields in cascading section](Cascading_6.png)

If you select the Custom option, then instead of "Primary element" you can define the table and select an item from it.   

![Image showing custom fields in cascading section](Cascading_7.jpeg)  

The two new fields that appear on selecting Custom configuration are:

1. Linked to List - This is a dropdown field and shall display the list of all the tables in the system. Select the relevant table here.

2. Linked to ID - This is also a dropdown list and displays the values of title column for the table selected. Please note, although you select the title column, the system actually retrieves its record ID value.

:::note[Important]  

The key point to note here is that when in Custom Mode, a single Lookup can also presents a filtered list as the parameters of the Primary Lookup are hard passed to it.

In the above image, although the selected Department is IT, however, the employees of Projects Department are shown as per the Custom configuration.

:::tip[Important Points to note about Cascading Lookups]

1. Cascading Lookups can function without establishing relationships via Connections.

2. Care must be given while selecting the columns of Primary and Dependent Lookups based on Table definition. Both the columns should return comparable values. For instance, if one of the columns is a Lookup, it returns an ID value. Comparing this to a string will give an error.

3. Cascading lookups work as one pair. You can define the same Primary for multiple Dependents.

4. You can define a Multi-lookup as a Dependent as well. However, a Multi-lookups cannot function as Primary because the value matching is supported for one variable only.
