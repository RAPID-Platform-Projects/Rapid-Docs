# 1.45.0 - Rapid Platform

This release sees only minor architectural changes with no anticipated change in behaviour. While these changes are not mechanical, they are very wide reaching. This release has been isolated to ensure stable performance.

As with every release, if you notice anything strange or have any feedback please do get in touch via support or the new [general feedback form](https://rpform.io/grxAZ).
