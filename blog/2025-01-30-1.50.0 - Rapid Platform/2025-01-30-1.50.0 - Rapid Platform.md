# 1.50.0 - Rapid Platform

Announcing **Rapid Platform release 1.50.0**, packed with exciting updates, including the ability to generate PowerPoint and Excel files through workflows, add new items to data tables with ease, and organise your activity feed with collapsible items for a clearer overview. These enhancements make managing your work smoother and more efficient!

## New Features
- **PowerPoint and Excel File Generation in Workflows:** Users can now generate PowerPoint and Excel files through workflows, enabling streamlined reporting and presentation creation.
- **Creating Items via a Data Table:** Users can now add new items directly via data tables, simplifying data entry.
- **Collapsible Activity Feed Items:** Users can now collapse and expand each item in the activity feed, providing a broader and more organised view of all logged activities.
- **Gantt Chart Enhancements:** Gantt users can now view more than 250 items on Gantt charts, enabling better project management for large datasets.
- **Middle-Click Navigation in Data Tables:** Users can now middle-click on a title field in a Data Table to open it in a new tab.

## Bug Fixes
- **Embedded File Templates:** Embedded file templates in Adaptive V3 now support single file uploads as expected, but modifications to allow multiple file uploads remain unsupported.
- **Adaptive V3 Placeholder Support:** Placeholder text added to choice fields in Adaptive V3 now appears as intended, providing clearer guidance for users.
- **Icon Overlap Issues:** Resolved overlapping issues when hovering over:
  - The description icon on an input field.
  - The public form link on a generate form ID field.
- **Multi-Lookup Configuration:** The parent list type is now omitted from configuration when setting up related connections in Adaptive V3, as multi-lookups between the same list type are not supported.
- **User Column Default Value:** Fixed an issue where User columns with a default value set to `@me` were being incorrectly updated to the platform user "Rapid Platform" during workflow data can updates.
- **Min/Max Relative Offset Toggle:** Addressed a bug where public forms treated the min/max relative offset as enabled even when toggled off in Adaptive V3.
- **Lookup Clicks in Pre-Fill Tasks:** Fixed a page crash occurring when clicking a lookup during data pre-filling on user tasks.
- **Placeholder in Choice Fields:** Fixed a bug where placeholders in choice fields appeared as selectable choices.
- **Label Component in Explorer:** Resolved a bug where the text in label components was vertically cut off.
- **Element Selection in Adaptive V3:** Fixed an issue where clicking elements in the Element Tree did not select them.
