# 1.51.0 - Rapid Platform

Introducing **Rapid Platform Release 1.51.0**. This update implements an overhaul to our Page Designer, refines numerous Adaptive v3 controls and enhances payment collection via persistent forms. See below for more details:

## New Features
- **Page Designer Overhaul:** We've made a major upgrade to how pages in **Explorer** are configured! This update improves usability by enhancing how fields can be placed and resized. Page fields in the Designer now correctly obey the placement indicator, resulting in a faster and smoother user experience.
- **Persistent Form Payment Collection:** Users can now collect payments through a persistent form link, simplifying recurring transactions and payment processing.

## Bug Fixes
- **Lookup Flyouts in Forms:** Flyouts on lookup components now follow the target container properly when scrolling on the page.
- **Choice Control Color Persistence:** Fixed an issue where choice colors set in Adaptive V3 disappeared after navigating away and back to the configuration panel.
- **Adaptive V3 Element Naming:** Fixed an issue where renaming an element in the tree caused the name to revert unexpectedly.
- **Adaptive V3 Control Logic Fixes:**  
  - **NULL Target Values & Operators:** Operators such as "omit" now function correctly when the target value is NULL.  
  - **Fetch Item on Load:** Resolved delays in simultaneous updates on form fields linked to the same column connection.  
  - **Number Input Restrictions:**  
    - Removing MIN, MAX, or STEP SIZE no longer forces a value of 0.  
    - Fixed an issue where some manually entered numbers were blocked due to strict validation rules.  
- **View Connections in Adaptive Designer:** Users can now properly add elements in the context of their table when working with view (repeating section) connections.
- **Slow Internet & Public Forms:** Uploading large public forms with slow internet no longer triggers an incorrect Captcha error.

This release continues to refine the platform, making page configuration, workflow execution, and payment collection more reliable and user-friendly. As always, we appreciate your feedbackâ€”keep it coming! ðŸš€
