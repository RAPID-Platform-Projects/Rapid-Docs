# 1.53.0 - Rapid Platform

This update includes important bug fixes, usability enhancements, and new features aimed at improving adaptive form workflows, permissions management, and public form access.  

## New Features

- **Dynamic Task Descriptions with Prefilled Data**  
  Task descriptions within workflows can now include **Lodash expressions** and **HTML** to dynamically prefill relevant information. This ensures that task assignees receive the context they need to complete tasks accurately and efficiently.

- **Public Form Usage Without Admin Consent**  
  Users can now access **public forms for non-file purposes** without requiring administrative consent, enabling streamlined form distribution.

- **Column-Based Filtering on Boards and Lists**  
  Users can now select a **specific column from a configured table** to use as a filter on Board and List components. This enhancement provides greater control and flexibility in organizing and displaying data.

## Bug Fixes

- **Permission Search Behavior**  
  Corrected an issue where the permission search was **case sensitive** and only matched column names. Searches now recognize both case and column titles for improved usability.

- **Adaptive Control Connection Setup**  
  Resolved an issue preventing users from **configuring a connection** when adding a new Adaptive control.

- **Tristate Toggle Condition Handling**  
  Fixed inconsistent behavior in **Tristate Toggle controls** when using conditional logic in V3 Adaptive forms.

- **Date and DateTime Default Value Handling**  
  Addressed an issue where removing default relative times from Date and DateTime fields incorrectly defaulted to **todayâ€™s date**.

- **Stale Values on Item Navigation**  
  Fixed a bug that caused **item values to become outdated** when navigating between records.

- **Divider Control Crash in V3 Documents**  
  Resolved a crash caused by clicking on a missing **Divider control** within the element tree of an Adaptive V3 document.

- **Duplicate Users in Placeholder Permissions**  
  Fixed a bug that allowed **duplicate user entries** when using placeholder permissions.
