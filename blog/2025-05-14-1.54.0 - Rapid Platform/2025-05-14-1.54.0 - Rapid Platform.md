# 1.54.0 - Rapid Platform

This release introduces key permission enhancements, stability improvements, and a variety of bug fixes to improve form interactions and data table functionality.

## New Features

- **Create Permission Granularity**  
  Introduced a `"Create"` permission type, allowing Keypers to fine-tune which users or groups can create list items.

- **Additive Permissions Model**  
  Permissions are now additive, meaning `"Allow"` permissions take precedence across group memberships. This ensures users in higher-privileged roles retain appropriate access even when also part of more restricted groups (i.e. All Staff Group).

## Bug Fixes

- **Lodash Expression in Send Email Task**  
  Resolved an issue where array-handling Lodash expressions in the CC field were not resolving correctly.

- **Neighbour Data Table Crash on Datasource Change**  
  Fixed a crash that occurred when changing a data table’s datasource with a linked neighbour table.

- **Groups in Adaptive If-Then Causing Crashes**  
  Prevented crashes caused by group logic placed within `If-Then` validation conditions in Adaptive.

- **Disabled Save Button in Inline Editing**  
  Fixed a UI issue where the Save button was incorrectly disabled when inline editing was attempted on a Data Table with creation turned off.

- **Multi-line Text Formatting in Documentation**  
  Corrected display issues with specific multi-line text formats in the Documentation component.

- **Overlapping Form Fields**  
  Resolved field layout overlap when all columns were added to a item page and a new item was created.

- **Arrow Key Navigation Blocked by Lookup Fields**  
  Addressed a keyboard navigation bug where movement using arrow keys stopped at lookup fields in Data Tables.

- **Selected Row Edited During Inline Creation**  
  Fixed unintended edits to previously selected Data Table rows when new items were created inline.

- **Date Picker UI Overlap**  
  Resolved UI conflict where the “Clear” button overlapped with the calendar icon in date/date-time fields.
