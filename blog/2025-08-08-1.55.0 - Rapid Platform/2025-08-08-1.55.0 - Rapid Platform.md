## New Feature: Dynamic Lookup Field Data Binding

### Smarter Pages with Lookup-Driven Auto-Fill

- You can now configure **lookup fields to automatically populate other fields** in the same record.  
- Perfect for scenarios such as:  
  - Selecting a **project template** to instantly apply default settings.  
  - Choosing a **material** in a quote item to pull in pricing or specifications from a price book.  
- Creates a **dynamic link between reference data and active inputs**, minimizing manual entry and improving data accuracy.

### How to Configure Lookup Data Binding

1. In **Designer**, go to the table containing your lookup column.  
2. Open the lookup column’s configuration panel.  
3. Enable **Data Binding**.  
4. Map the fields from the lookup’s source table to the corresponding fields in your destination table.
