We're excited to announce new features live on the Rapid Platform **Tuesday September 9th**!

This release focuses around usability improvements and fixes after the last major mono-repo release.

Please see below for more details:

## Custom Experiences

You can now build tailored experiences with unique menus and dashboard pages. Set specific permissions for users and groups to control access and visibility, giving you more flexibility than ever.

## Upgraded Breadcrumbs

Navigation just got easier. Youâ€™ll now see the last 3 places you visited, helping you move faster and stay oriented while working on deep items.

## New SharePoint to PDF Workflow Task

Automate more with our new workflow service task that takes a SharePoint file and generates a PDF version seamlessly.
