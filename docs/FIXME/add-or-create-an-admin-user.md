# Add or create an Admin user

Setting up an admin user in Azure AD is very simple; first, navigate to the "All users" page inside the Azure portal. While here, you should be able to see the button that says "New user".

Once you've clicked on the "New User" button, follow the steps that Microsoft Azure lays out for you.

You will then need to click on the user you just created; this will take you to that user's profile. Here you will set the user as the admin.

Navigate to the "Administrative units" panel found on the side panel to the left of the page, click on the "Assign to administrative unit", and follow the instructions on the page.
