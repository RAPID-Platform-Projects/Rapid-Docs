# All about Menus in Designer

Menus are among the fundamental options in Rapid Platform. A menu, most fundamentally, can be understood as a list of buttons. It allows users to easily navigate across information pages or assist in triggering specific actions.

The Menu options can be seen in the Designer Sidebar.

In principle there are two main applications of Menus to a user:

1. [Configuring the Sidebars (for Explorer and Designer).](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-customise-sidebars-using-menus "How to customise Sidebars using Menus?")
2. [Configuring the command bar in Explorer view of a data table.](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-configure-a-menu-button-in-a-command-bar "How to configure a Menu button in a command bar?")

##### Properties of a menu item

The appearance and behaviour of each menu item can be configured by defining the properties of a [***menu item***](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/glossary/page/menu-item "Menu item").

1. [Create a new Menu item, set display text and icon ](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-set-display-text-and-icon-for-a-menu-item "How to set display text and icon for a menu item?")
