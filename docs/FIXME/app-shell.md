# App Shell

The App shell, my thoughts are it needs to be a light weight and as minimal as it can be, I recon it should be as simple as providing Auth using pure msal (no sdk), and a basic design around it using no libraries other then the radiex UI.

The thinking there is, you have a stable base to start off from, where you can then pull in the SDK and decide what other Adaptive-\* packages your app will need. that way we can update all our other packages, with out having to touch the Shell App.
