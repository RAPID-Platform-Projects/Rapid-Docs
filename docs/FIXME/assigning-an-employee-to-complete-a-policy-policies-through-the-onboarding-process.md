# Assigning an employee to complete a policy / policies through the onboarding process

### Overview

When a new employee is created, by default this triggers the onboarding process. If in the create screen you have selected a policy or policies for them to complete, as part of the onboarding process they will receive an email with links to each of the selected policies and a form to confirm that they have read each of these policies.

To do this simply follow the steps on the “Create, edit, or delete and employee” page.

### How to assign policies for an employee to acknowledge on creation of the employee item
