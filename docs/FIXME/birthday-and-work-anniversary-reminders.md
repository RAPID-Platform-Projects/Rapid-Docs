# Birthday and Work Anniversary Reminders

### Overview

Within the Employee's module, we have incorporated two methods to stay informed about upcoming employee birthdays and work anniversaries. The first method involves email reminders, which are detailed on this page, while the second option is the birthday and work anniversary calendar, elaborated upon here.

### Details

Email reminders are a convenient feature that automatically dispatches reminder emails for forthcoming employee birthdays and work anniversaries. This feature serves as a valuable tool for managers, enabling them to recognize and celebrate their employees, thereby enhancing overall company morale.

The reminder email is sent to the employeeâ€™s direct manager.

To receive reminders for employee birthdays and work anniversaries, the following fields are required: **Manager**, **DOB** and **Start Date**. The manager field specifies who the reminders are sent to via email, while the **DOB** and **Work Start Date** fields are used to determine the next birthday and next work anniversary respectively.

Should a manager prefer not to receive email reminders, they can easily configure this within their employee profile by setting the **Birthday Reminders** and **Work Anniversary Reminders** to False. By doing so, they will opt out of receiving reminders for either of these events.

### How to opt-out of receiving employee Birthday and Work anniversary reminders

As a manager, by default you will receive birthday and work anniversary reminders from any employees that have you listed as their direct manager. To switch these off follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to Human Resources &gt; Employees
