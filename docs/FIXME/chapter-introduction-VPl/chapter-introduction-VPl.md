# Chapter Introduction

Many a times, there is a need to display data based on conditions. For example - if the variable "account status" is not active, then you would want to send an email stating "Your account is blocked!". Such are the applications of a conditional statement.

In this chapter we will discuss the Basic if, else, else if conditional statement. A step-wise discussion can be found on the next page of this chapter.

  
There can be other types of Conditional Statements and applications like :

- Unless
- greaterThan
- lessThan
- Equals
- notEquals
- And
- Or
- Length etc.
