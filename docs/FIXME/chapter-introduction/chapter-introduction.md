# Chapter Introduction

Dynamic templates derive their name from the fact that they can dynamically produce emails with personalised data.

In this chapter, we will discuss this aspect of configuring templates with variables and will also show how email can be previewed through test data.

This is known as Substitution.

The chapter discusses simple substitution method and dynamic link set up.

There can be other applications like:

- Deep Object Replacement,
- Object Failure,
- Date Format,
- Insert etc.

You can learn about these in more detail at - [https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/using-handlebars#substitution](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/using-handlebars#substitution)
