# Converting a Lead

### Overview

When a lead has been **Converted** this will create an Account, Contact, and Opportunity. Generally, this will occur once the client has been qualified and potential work is on the horizon. After conversion you can manage each Opportunity which allows for more granular reporting. For more information on the Sales Dashboard please see the following page.
