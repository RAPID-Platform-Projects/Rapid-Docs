### Deleting Contacts

It is not recommended to delete a contact if no longer active; instead, change its status to **Archived**" This way, you can maintain a list of all your Contacts, and always reinstate a contact to **Active** if needed.

However, if you need to delete a contact due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple assets at once.
