### Deleting Departments

It is not recommended to delete a department instead, change its status to **Archived**. This way you can maintain a record of past and current departments.

However, if you need to delete a department due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple departments at once.
