### Deleting Employee Records

It is not recommended to delete an employee instead, change its status to "Archived." This way you can maintain a record of past and current employees.

However, if you need to delete an employee due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple employees at once.
