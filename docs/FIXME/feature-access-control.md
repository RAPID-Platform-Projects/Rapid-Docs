# Feature Access Control

*Rapid* allows the restricting of certain users or user groups to access certain *Rapid Experiences*. These include the following;

- ***Explorer***: The primary way of viewing data within the *RAPID Site*
- ***Designer***: The primary way of modifying and configuring a *RAPID Site*
- ***Workflow***: Creating and executing business processes
- ***Tasks***: A list of tasks assigned to the user viewing them
- ***Public Forms:*** A way of presenting forms for data entry to unauthenticated 3rd parties

It is possible to enable *Access Control* on Explorer, Designer &amp; Workflow (collectively known as Core Rapid).

### Configuring Access Control

Enabling *Access Control* on an experience is a simple process. First, navigate to any experience through the *Designer* navigation bar. *Rapid Experiences* will be listed under the sub-heading called *Features*.

### Experience 404

If an experience has been disabled for a user, any attempts to access that experience will result in a 404 page being presented.
