# Feature Access Control

*Rapid* allows the restricting of certain users or user groups to access certain *Rapid Experiences*. These include the following;

- ***Explorer***: The primary way of viewing data within the *RAPID Site*
- ***Designer***: The primary way of modifying and configuring a *RAPID Site*
- ***Workflow***: Creating and executing business processes
- ***Tasks***: A list of tasks assigned to the user viewing them
- ***Public Forms:*** A way of presenting forms for data entry to unauthenticated 3rd parties

It is possible to enable *Access Control* on Explorer, Designer &amp; Workflow (collectively known as Core Rapid).
