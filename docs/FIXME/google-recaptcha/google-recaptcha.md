# Google reCAPTCHA

The anonymous forms feature makes use of the google reCAPTCHA box, this is a check box that renders on the form page. The form will be disabled until the google reCAPTCHA checkbox is clicked. This is a spam protection service offered by google, making sure that your form doesn't get spammed.

The checkbox also has a 2-minute timeout, when the user has clicked the checkbox, they have 2-minutes to submit the form, otherwise the reCAPTCHA wil fail and the user will have to click the box again.
