# How to configure / update component properties?

##### **What are properties of a component?**

Each component, based on its nature, allows you to configure properties. These properties define the behaviour of the component in Explorer.

For example :

A Counter component will allow you to define which table you wish to select and the Table View.

Whereas a Gantt Chart component will allow you to select other relevant options (shown below).

The properties for a component can be defined in their respective "Edit" Properties panel.

##### **How to access "Edit" Properties panel?**

Every component has a horizontal options panel at the bottom right corner of its boundary. Look for the pencil icon. As you click on this icon, the Edit panel will open for the component on the right side.
