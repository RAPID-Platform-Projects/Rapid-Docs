# How to create a Page in Designer?

There are two ways of creating a [Page](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/glossary/page/page-layout-and-component "Page, layout and component") in Rapid Platform.

1. via the Design Tab of a [Table in Designer](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/all-about-tables-in-designer "All about Tables in Designer")
2. via the Pages Manager in [Designer Sidebar](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/glossary/page/sidebar "Sidebar").

You may have read the introduction about these two methods [here](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/all-about-pages-in-designer "All about Pages in Designer").

#### **Creating a Page using Design Tab of a Table in Designer**

To create a new page from within a Table, you need to use the [Tab Strip Layout](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/what-are-the-available-layouts-for-pages "How to add a Layout to a Page?").

**Scenario:**

Let us assume you have an Incidents Table. You want to create a new page that will display a Report on Fatal Incidents.

**Scope and rationale:**

This article limits the discussion to creation of a New Page in the system. The discussion on [how to add a Report Component](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-add-a-component-to-a-layout-page "How to add a component to a Layout / Page?") is covered separately.

Since the page is relevant to the Table, we are creating the same from the Design Tab of the Table in Designer.

There can be two cases here:

1. Create page on Item Details (Singular)
2. Create page on Item group (Plural)

##### **1. Creating a New Page on Item Details (Singular)**

**Please follow the below steps:**

**If you wish to add a page to the [Item Details breakpoint](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/all-about-pages-in-designer "All about Pages in Designer"), then a Tab Strip Layout is present by default on it.**

**As you press Save, your new page will be created. You can then add Layout or Components as desired.**

#####   


##### **2. Creating a New Page on Item group (Plural)**

In case of Plural (Item group) Details breakpoint, the Tab Strip is not available by default.

**Please follow the below steps:**

**![Picture 6.png](./downloaded_image_1705285617317.png)**

**You can then follow Step 3. onwards as discussed above in Singular's case.**

#### **Creating a Page using the Page Manager from Designer Sidebar**

Imagine you wish to create a CRM Report Dashboard, something that is not directly related to any single table. In such a scenario you do not need to create a page that is dependent on a Table.

*\*A page is called dependent on a table when created via the Design Tab of a Table in Designer.*

To create independent page from Page Manager, please consider the following steps:

![7.png](./downloaded_image_1705285624436.png)

![8.png](./downloaded_image_1705285625453.png)

**Please note :**

**1. Here you have created a page independent of any Table in the System.**

**2. There is no need to create a page using Tab Strip Layout.**

**3. You can next add a layout on either Details or Create Screen breakpoints.**
