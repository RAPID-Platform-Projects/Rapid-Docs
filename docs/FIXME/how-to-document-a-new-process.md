# How to document a new Process

To make sure everyone has access to important information and to provide context for future work, it is expected that when a new member or internal process is created, the consultant responsible will document it and update internal systems.

Follow these steps after creating a new process:

1. Document the process: 
    - Log in to the [Rapid Platform Documentation](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/)
    - Go to Shelves &gt; Simpli User Manual &gt; Simpli Processes &gt; Simpli Internal Processes or Simpli Member Processes.
    - Create a new page by clicking "new page".
    - Title the page with the title of the process used in the rapid site.
    - Write a clear, plain-English description of the process.
    - Add a diagram showing the relationships between tables used in the process. These can be created using [io](https://app.diagrams.net/) using the Entity Relation Shapes and Containers as seen in the image below![](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-02/qWvH0R9o7pScMYE0-embedded-image-qo8dvyhw.png)
2. Create a new Process on the Processes Table: 
    - Link the process to any tables used throughout the process.
