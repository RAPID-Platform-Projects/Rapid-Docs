# How to edit / delete table views in Designer?

#### Overview

When viewing a table, by default all of the items will appear on the list. It is possible however to construct **Views** to filter the items as needed. A basic example would be on the hypothetical **Leads** list. If you view it, by default all leads will appear. However, you may only want to view **Leads** that with a status of **New**. As such you can construct a view and call it **New** and when selected the list will only show leads with a status of new. Once constructed views can be used by anyone in the system and are easily accessible through the view selector on that table.

The image below shows the **All** view.
