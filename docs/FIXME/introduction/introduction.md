# Introduction

Emails are among the most common and cost-effective modes of professional communication. SendGrid provides a reliable and scalable email infrastructure.

RAPID Platform can seamlessly connect with SendGrid and can be configured to send auto-generated emails to desired recipients.

This tutorial discusses how to setup SendGrid account and integrate it to a RAPID site.

This integration requires us to perform the following steps:

1\) Signup for a SendGrid Account.  
2\) Create SendGrid API Keys.  
3\) Setup a new Sender in SendGrid.  
4\) Adding Inbound Parse in SendGrid.  
5\) Create a RAPID Site on the tenant and Integrate SendGrid API with RAPID Site.

Each of the above points are separate chapters of this book, discussed sequentially.

Here is a link to the video showcasing the whole process :
