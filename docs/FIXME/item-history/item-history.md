As an item is changed throughout time the history list will expand. A key feature of the item's history is that you are able to select a previous state of the item and revert the item. To achieve this, simply click on an entry in the item history. This will change the contents of the item to display the historical view. The changes however will not be committed unless the item is saved. Pressing the Undo button whilst viewing a historical view will revert the contents of the item back to its current state. **Note:** Item History Does not track changes in Universal links added to an item
