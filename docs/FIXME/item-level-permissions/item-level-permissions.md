# Item-Level Permissions

This is the Item's permissions configuration. It lists the users and groups which have access to the item. These are displayed as a user coin. To open more details as to what users exactly you are able to click on the 'Edit Permissions' button this will bring up the Permissions management config for that particular item.

*Item Permission Configuration*

From the permissions configuration you are able to add, remove and modify permissions for that item. The changes made through this configuration are at the item level meaning they will not affect any other previously made or items made in the future with the exception of cloning an item. You are able to only add existing users and groups to the permission to the item which are known to the particular Rapid site. If the user you are looking for is not in the list, it is advised to revisit the principals table, to import a user(s) or group(s) if necessary. The Default can be configured manually but by default, the permissions are set to the primary group and user (who made the site).
