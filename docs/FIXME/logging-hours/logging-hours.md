# Logging Hours

## Where to log hours

To log hours against a task, the task must be a Client Task. Simply go to the tasks experience of whichever site the task is on and select your task.

The Task Experience can be accessed via  ***https://tasks.rapidplatform.com/\_prod/(SITE)/(TENNANT)***

Alternatively, if your site has the hour log and task dashboard on the launchpad, simply go to the tasks tab, find your task, and click the hyperlink next to it.

## How to log hours

To select a Client Task to log hours against, you will want to change the view filter at the top of the list of tasks on the left **(1)**. *'My Client Tasks', 'Client Tasks' and 'My Completed Client Tasks'* should help you navigate to the tasks you need. You can simply click through all your Tasks and log hours as needed.

With a Client Task selected the log hours form will display on the page as below (assuming the client task has no other form attached to it (eg. through workflow) ).

Simply fill in the user who worked the hours, how many hours were worked, and the date the hours were worked.

***Note: Type may not be required, if you don't know that you need it, just leave it blank.***

It is useful to document what you did during the hours logged. Please try to be concise and brief.

You can add more repeating sections to log as many hours on as many days as you like.

***Note: currently there is an issue with repeating sections and descriptions, Please avoid removing sections, it may remove or replace existing time logs. Removing a section you have filled out, will NOT delete that item. To delete a time log you will have to go through rapid explorer.***

Once you have logged your hours, click 'SAVE' **(2)** at the top of the page.

You may also press complete, but note that this will complete the TASK you have selected (as well as saving the hours logged)
