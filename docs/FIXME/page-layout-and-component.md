# Page, layout and component

##### **Page**

A Page is a fundamental element in Rapid Platform. Consider a broad analogy of a blank page of a notebook. You can write something on a page and then this page can be read by others. Similarly, in Rapid Platform parlance, a page can be considered as an area to host components.   
  
Rapid Platform features components like Gantt Charts, Kanban Boards, Data Tables, Activity feeds, Forms, PowerBI Reports etc.

All of these can be configured on a page for data presentation.

##### **Layout**

A layout can be considered as a section on a page. Layouts define the arrangement of components across the page.

Layouts serve three main purposes:

1. Without a layout you cannot add multiple components to a page. You can only have one component on a page without layout.
2. It assists in defining the arrangement of components on a page.
3. If you want to hide / show all the components on Details or Creation, it can be done with a single click
