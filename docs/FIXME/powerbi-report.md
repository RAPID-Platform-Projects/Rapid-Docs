# PowerBI Report

## Editing a PowerBI Report

If editing is enabled, there will be an **Edit** button in the top right of the PowerBI Component. This will enable edit mode which will allow you to edit and save the report. Being in *Edit* mode gives you full control over the visualisations of the report. The only thing which is not possible, is the changing of the data source for the report.
