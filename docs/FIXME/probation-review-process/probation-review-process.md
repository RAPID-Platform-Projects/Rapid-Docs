# Probation Review Process

### Overview

The Rapid Core Human Resources module comes with a probation review process out-of-the-box. This empowers employers to track the progress and support employees as they go through their probationary period. This process automates the assignment of questionnaires to both new employees and their managers, assessing their integration within the company. This valuable feedback equips management with the insights necessary to make adjustments and foster continued growth.

### Triggers

The process is triggered in two ways:

1. **Automated Trigger:** On creation of the employee, if the “Trigger Probation Reviews” toggle is true, the process will automatically be live for this employee.
2. **Manuel Trigger:** The second way to trigger the process is by creating a “Probation Review” item.
