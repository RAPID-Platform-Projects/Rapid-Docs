# Registration Expiry and Service Reminders

Built into the Assetâ€™s module is a feature that automatically assigns tasks for upcoming registration expiry or service dates. This ensures that assets are properly maintained, and registration remains up to date.

To receive reminders for service dates or registration expiry, simply ensure that the "Next Service Date" or "Registration Expiry" fields on the asset are filled with a future date.

The reminder task will be generated one month prior to the selected "Next Service Date" or "Registration Expiry" and will be assigned to the "Asset Management Group". Any user who is a member of that group will receive the task, such as to "Renew Registration for Vehicle 000001".
