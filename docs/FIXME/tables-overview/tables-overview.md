# Tables Overview

Tables are used to group together items that share common fields. They are analogous to a spreadsheet.

Each Table contains multiple columns (or fields) that store data of a particular type (text, date, currency, etc). Each row (called an item) on the table then represents some instance of those columns.

Rapid provides a baseline set of Tables as well as the ability to create and edit entirely custom tables that can represent your own business data.

Tables are managed in Designer and power all the Rapid Experiences.
