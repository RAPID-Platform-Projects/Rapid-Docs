### Using the HR Calendar

#### Slicers

Slicers provides the user with the ability to filter the calendar by: Departments, Employee, or Type. This means that if you only want to see birthdays for the “Sales Department” you can set the “Department” slicer to “Sales” and the “Type” slicer to “Birthday”.
