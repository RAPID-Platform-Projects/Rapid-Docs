### Using the Leave Calendar

#### Slicers

Slicers provides the user with the ability to filter the calendar by: Departments, Employee, or Approval Status. This means that if you only want to see approved leave requests for the “Sales Department” you can set the “Department” slicer to “Sales” and the “Approval Status” slicer to “Approved”.
