# What is a Data Table component on a Layout / Page?

##### **What is a Data Table component?**

Imagine you are the Project Manager and wish to view the list of all "Active" Projects. This list is possible on the **[Page](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/glossary/page/page-layout-and-component "Page, layout and component")** using the Data Table component.

In simple words, a data table component allows you to insert a view of the **[data table](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/glossary/page/data-table "Data Table")** to a Page.

Therefore to display a list of items, you need to:

1. Define which table you want the system to refer.
2. Define the **[Table View](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences-oxn/page/data-table-component-views "Data Table Component - Views")** you want to set for displaying the Table Data.

##### **How to set up Data Table component in Designer?**

- You can **[add the Data Table component on to the Layout / Page](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-add-a-component-to-a-layout-page "How to add a component to a Layout / Page?").** The Data Table component is present on the Item Group (Plural) Details breakpoint **[by default](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-configure-item-details-and-item-creation "How to configure Item Details and Item Creation?")**. It is set to the subject Table and All View.

- You can Add the Data Table component on both ***Singular Item Details breakpoint Pages*** as well as ***Plural Item Group Details Breakpoint***.
- If the Data Table component is on a Grid Layout, you can **[resize and move the component over the layout](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-arrange-a-component-on-grid-layout "How to arrange a component on Grid layout?").**
- You can set the **[visibility of Data Table on the Details breakpoint](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-set-a-component-to-be-visible-hidden-on-item-details-and-create-breakpoints "How to set a component to be visible / hidden on "Item Details" and "Create" breakpoints?").

- As the Data Table component is added to the Layout / Page, it is shown as Red. This indicates the component configuration is missing. [![Screenshot 2023-11-08 at 8.31.11 PM.png](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-11/scaled-1680-/NbOEcu8qxCzs6qHX-screenshot-2023-11-08-at-8-31-11-pm.png)](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-11/NbOEcu8qxCzs6qHX-screenshot-2023-11-08-at-8-31-11-pm.png)

    - Once the table is selected, you can select the desired View from the list of existing Table Views. Although, the dialogue mentions it is required to select a View, however, if you leave it blank, the system will take the "All" View as default.

        - - - You can disable the Create Item button visibility on Explorer window. [![1.png](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-11/scaled-1680-/tXUYX8VgYUcqubgl-1.png)](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-11/tXUYX8VgYUcqubgl-1.png)

                - You can disable the view selection button visibility on Explorer window. [![4.png](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-11/scaled-1680-/wo5dybNrLuAtQJgH-4.png)](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-11/wo5dybNrLuAtQJgH-4.png)
    - After configuring all the fields, you need to press "Save". [![Screenshot 2023-11-08 at 9.23.06 PM.png](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-11/scaled-1680-/96UqnXeebxvXUgHk-screenshot-2023-11-08-at-9-23-06-pm.png)](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-11/96UqnXeebxvXUgHk-screenshot-2023-11-08-at-9-23-06-pm.png)

**Please note:**

- The first option in the list of Table Views is a blank option. If you select the same, the system selects the "All" View.[![Screenshot 2023-11-06 at 8.26.52 PM.png](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-11/scaled-1680-/PHdFM1QCn0ulZpWf-screenshot-2023-11-06-at-8-26-52-pm.png)](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-11/PHdFM1QCn0ulZpWf-screenshot-2023-11-06-at-8-26-52-pm.png)
- The Data Table component can be set up for both Individual Item level (Singular) or Item group level (Plural). However, for Singular Item Details, it will show only the linked items in the list. For example: Let us assume you are on a Data Table - Projects. You have added a Data Table component on the Singular Item Details Page. You have configured it to Table - Project Meetings. In Explorer, when you select a Project Item and open its Details Page, only the Project Meetings linked to the select Project Item will be shown.
- Do not forget to hit the "Save" button for the changes made in the Page to take effect.
