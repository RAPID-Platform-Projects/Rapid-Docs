# What is a File Browser component on a Layout / Page?

##### **What is a File Browser component?**

Rapid Platform allows you to set up SharePoint folders for each item. The File Browser component can be perceived as an interface to the relevant SharePoint folder. It allows you to access the relevant SharePoint folder, upload new files, view the contents of the folder, add folders and much more, all from within the Explorer interface.

##### **How to set up File Browser component in Designer?**

<div class="pointer-container" id="bkmrk-%C2%A0"><div class="pointer anim is-page-editable"><svg class="svg-icon" data-icon="link" role="presentation" viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></svg><div class="input-group inline block"><input id="bkmrk-" placeholder="url" readonly="readonly" type="text"></input> <button class="button outline icon" data-clipboard-target="#pointer-url" title="Copy Link" type="button"><svg class="svg-icon" data-icon="copy" role="presentation" viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></svg></button></div><svg class="svg-icon" data-icon="edit" role="presentation" viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></svg></div></div>- You can **[add the File Browser component on to the Layout / Page](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-add-a-component-to-a-layout-page "How to add a component to a Layout / Page?")**. This component is present on the Individual Item (Singular) Details breakpoint **[by default](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-configure-item-details-and-item-creation "How to configure Item Details and Item Creation?")**. It is in the Files Tab.

- If the File Browser component is on a Grid Layout, you can **[resize and move the component over the layout](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-arrange-a-component-on-grid-layout "How to arrange a component on Grid layout?").**
- You can set the **[visibility of File Browser on the Details breakpoint](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-set-a-component-to-be-visible-hidden-on-item-details-and-create-breakpoints "How to set a component to be visible / hidden on "Item Details" and "Create" breakpoints?").

**Please note:**

- Although Files Browser component is present on the Files Tab of the Individual Item (Singular) Details breakpoint **[by default,](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-configure-item-details-and-item-creation "How to configure Item Details and Item Creation?")** you can add it to other layouts as well.
- Files Browser component provides an interface to the Individual Item's SharePoint folder, therefore, although you can (theoretically) add the component to the Group Items List (Plural) level, yet it doesn't make logical purpose there.
- You can configure the default for preview pane from Designer, however, you can open / close the preview pane in Explorer.
- It is worth noting that for each data table has a SharePoint Folder allocated within a SharePoint Drive. Each new item is created as a folder within the Table's SharePoint folder. The File Browser points to the item's SharePoint Folder.
