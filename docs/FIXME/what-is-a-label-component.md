# What is a Label component?

##### **What is a Label component?**

Imagine you have four components stacked on a Grid Layout or there have been a bunch of fields in the Form component. You want to give more context to the information.

This is where the Label component is useful. A Label component is like a text tag that can be placed to organise a bunch of information on the page and provide more context for interpretation.

##### **How to set up Label component on a Layout / Page?**

- You can **[add the Label component on to the Layout / Page](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-add-a-component-to-a-layout-page "How to add a component to a Layout / Page?")**. The Label component is not present anywhere by default. **[![Comp L.png](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-11/scaled-1680-/d81RZqya9wocZBE4-comp-l.png)](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-11/d81RZqya9wocZBE4-comp-l.png)**
- If the Label component is on a Grid Layout, you can **[resize and move the component over the layout](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-arrange-a-component-on-grid-layout "How to arrange a component on Grid layout?").**
- You can set the **[visibility of Label on the Details breakpoint](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-set-a-component-to-be-visible-hidden-on-item-details-and-create-breakpoints "How to set a component to be visible / hidden on "Item Details" and "Create" breakpoints?").

- You can set the **[visibility of Label on the Create Screen breakpoint](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-set-a-component-to-be-visible-hidden-on-item-details-and-create-breakpoints "How to set a component to be visible / hidden on "Item Details" and "Create" breakpoints?").** [![L2.png](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-11/scaled-1680-/2vLLvrXoNRaNvqU2-l2.png)](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-11/2vLLvrXoNRaNvqU2-l2.png)

##### **How to set up Label component on a Form?**

- Just like adding Label component to the Layout, you can add it within the [Form component](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/what-is-a-form-component-on-a-layout-page "What is a Form Component on a Layout / Page?") as well.

Please refer to the below video for illustration:

- Similar to Label on Grid Layout, you can [move and resize](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-arrange-a-component-on-grid-layout), set visibility over [Details breakpoint](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-set-a-component-to-be-visible-hidden-on-item-details-and-create-breakpoints) and [Create Screen breakpoint](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-set-a-component-to-be-visible-hidden-on-item-details-and-create-breakpoints).

**Please note:**

- The Label component is ideally used for putting up label text for a few words. You cannot press Enter and put multiple lines of text in the Label. However, you can write text in a single line.
- There no Edit (pencil) icon to configure the Label component, as this component doesn't have any settings to define behaviour of the component.
