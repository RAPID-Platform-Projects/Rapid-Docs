# What is a Policy Acknowledgement?

When an employee is assigned a task to acknowledge, for example, the “Antibullying” and “Data Privacy” policies, this will create two “Policy Acknowledgement” items in the system. As the task automatically sends them an email to complete the initial status of the policy acknowledgement is “Sent”.

Once the employee acknowledges the policy the status of the Policy Acknowledgement item will change to “acknowledged”. This means that we can track exactly which employees have been set a task to acknowledge a specific policy, and on top of that, if they have or have not acknowledged the policy.
