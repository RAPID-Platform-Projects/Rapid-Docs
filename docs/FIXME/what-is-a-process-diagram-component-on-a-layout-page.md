# What is a Process Diagram component on a Layout / Page?

##### **What is a Process Diagram component ?**

As the name suggests, a Process Diagram component will display the Process Diagram on a page. If this component is added properly, it will display the relevant Process Diagram associated with the item on the page.

##### **Important note**

**This component cannot be meaningfully added to any page. A table should have a column by the type - XML Data to host a Process Diagram component. XML Data type of columns cannot be added with the Rapid UI. There is a specialised way to add such columns to the Table, which is beyond the scope of explanation of this article.**
