# What is an Attachments component on a Layout / Page?

##### **What is an Attachments component?**

The Files Tab ([File Browser component](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/what-is-a-file-browser-component-on-a-layout-page "What is a File Browser component on a Layout / Page?")) is the place to upload / view files with reference to an item. However, in real-life business scenarios the Files Tab can a long list, and sometimes heavy files.

Attachments typically serve the need for referencing a small number of lightweight files, which can be referenced easily and frequently (in Explorer).

Attachments are visible in the [Tasks experience](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/glossary/page/task-experience "Task Experience").

<div class="pointer-container" id="bkmrk-%C2%A0-0"><div class="pointer anim is-page-editable"><svg class="svg-icon" data-icon="link" role="presentation" viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></svg><div class="input-group inline block"><input id="bkmrk--0" placeholder="url" readonly="readonly" type="text"></input> <button class="button outline icon" data-clipboard-target="#pointer-url" title="Copy Link" type="button"><svg class="svg-icon" data-icon="copy" role="presentation" viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></svg></button></div><svg class="svg-icon" data-icon="edit" role="presentation" viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></svg></div></div>- The option to Edit preferences (pencil icon) is not present in this component.
- The files uploaded in the Attachments component can be previewed using the [File Preview component](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/what-is-a-file-preview-component-on-a-layout-page "What is a File Preview component on a Layout / Page?").
- To effectively upload files in the Attachments component, it is important to have the [Document Storage (SharePoint Folder) configured in the Options Tab of the Table in Designer.](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-view-update-table-options-of-an-existing-table-in-designer#bkmrk-document-storage)
- The Attachments component, although can be added to both Individual Item Level and Group Item List Level, logically it is meaningful to have it at the Individual Item Level.
