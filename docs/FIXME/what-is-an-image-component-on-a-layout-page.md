# What is an Image component on a Layout / Page?

##### **What is an Image component?**

Imagine you want to your company logo and branding elements to appear at the top of the Data Table List view or Items view.

This can be done using the image component.

The image component allows you to associate an image with the item(s).

However, please note that you cannot upload your image files directly to the Image component, rather you would need to upload and host it on an application and provide the url reference for the same.
