# Welcome

Welcome to Rapid Platform. This documentation site is structured to support users of various abilities and expertise.

## User Manual Docs

This documentation is useful for regular users who want to learn the basic concepts underpinning Rapid Platform, or for users who have a custom-built site. While power users may find some benefits to learning the system fundamentals here, this section is instead written for users with less technical experience and focuses on Rapid's core applications: **Explorer** and **Tasks**.

## Keyper Manual

The Keyper (Key Person) Manual is designed for power users who will be building and customising the Rapid Platform to suit the needs of their company. This section focuses on Rapid's other applications such as **Designer**, **Workflow**, and **Adaptive Designer** applications, rather than **Explorer**. This manual also assumes you understand the fundamentals of using Rapid.

## Developer Manual

The Developer Manual is useful for those who are looking to interact directly with the Rapid API, create their own custom front-ends, or simply extend the site with third-party automation and software integration. This section of the documentation assumes you have high-level technical expertise.
