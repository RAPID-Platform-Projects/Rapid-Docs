# Introducing Rapid Platform 

Welcome to the Rapid Platform.

## Get started using Rapid

<!-- TODO : Need the tasks link here too -->

The Rapid Platform is all about keeping things organised so you can focus on getting things done. [Tasks](/docs/Rapid/3-User%20Manual/1-rapid-overview/1-rapid-overview.md) help keep track of what needs to be done. [Custom tables](/docs/Rapid/3-User%20Manual/2-Explorer/1-Tables/1-viewing-data-using-tables/1-viewing-data-using-tables.md) keep all your data in one place, easy to share and never out of date.

[Processes](/docs/Rapid/3-User%20Manual/4-Workflow/workflow-introduction.md) help describe and automate tasks throughout Rapid, while [Notifications](/docs/Rapid/3-User%20Manual/2-Explorer/5-Notifications/5-Notifications.md) keep you up to date as the world changes.

## Start customising your experience

The Rapid Platform is all about making a system that works for your business.  Whether you want to [customize what data](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/1-Tables/1-all-about-tables-in-designer/1-all-about-tables-in-designer.md) you're tracking, [set up pages](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/1-all-about-pages-in-designer.md) to improve the experience, [create automated processes](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/3-Workflow/1-overview/1-overview.md) to simplify your business, or [generate public forms](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/4-Adaptive%20Designer/2-How%20to%20create%20a%20new%20Adaptive%20Document%20Form/2-How%20to%20create%20a%20new%20Adaptive%20Document%20Form.md) to capture data we've got you covered.

## For Developers:

The Rapid Platform is fully powered via our API, there's no special routes or back doors to any of our front ends. If you see something an Experience can do, you can create a custom UI that does it too! Check out our [API Docs](/docs/Rapid/5-Developer%20Manual/0-api-concepts.md) to get started interacting with Rapid.
