# Using the Tasks Board

## Overview
The task board is a great way to visualise the status of each of the project’s sub-tasks. It also provides the user the ability to easily move tasks between each of the status fields which will automatically update the status of that task. Moreover, the “view” can be changed to show tasks on the task board that are only your tasks or “All” tasks depending if you want visibility of your responsibilities or the tasks from the project as a whole.

## Accessing the Task Board
1. On the sidebar select **Tasks** > **Task Portal**

2. Select the **Task Board** tab

## Moving Items between status categories

1. Click and drag the task between columns. (This will update the status of the task from the column it started on to the column you “drop” it in)

The screenshot is annotated in red to demonstrate that the card should be clicked and dragged from its current column, and then released in a different column.](<Task Board Dragging Cards.png>)

2. Press **Save**

## Changing the View
The default view on the Task Board is the “My Tasks – All” view which shows all tasks assigned to the user or a group the user is a part of. This view can be changed to the “All” view to show all tasks in the project irrespective of who it is assigned to. To do this follow the steps below.

1. Click on the dropdown in the upper right corner above the task board which says “My Tasks – All”

This is a drop-down menu button that will open a series of other views to choose from, as well as an option at the bottom that reads "Create View". In this example, the button has the title "My Tasks - All", as this is the current view selected. The button also has an icon of a filter. The screenshot is annotated with a red arrow and red box to highlight the location of the view button.](<Task Board View Menu.png>)

2. From the list of view select the “All” view

3. The tasks board now shows all tasks in the project. The same steps can be used to revert the view back to “My Tasks – All”

![A screenshot that shows how the Command Strip button for changing the view will now display the title of the view selected. The menu button now reads "All", as this was the new view that was selected. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to highlight the location of this menu button.](<Task Board View Change.png>)

## Editing a Task from the Task Board

1. Open a Task by:
    - Double-clicking on the Task Card, or
    - Clicking on the title of the task you wish to edit

The screenshot is annotated with red text that reads "Double Click" and an arrow pointing to the cursor. The cursor and the card are both annotated with red boxes to highlight their location.](<Task Board Double Click.png>)
