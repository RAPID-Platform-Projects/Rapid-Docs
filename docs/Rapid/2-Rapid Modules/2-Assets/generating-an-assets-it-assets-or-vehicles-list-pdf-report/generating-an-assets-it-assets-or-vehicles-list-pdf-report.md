# Generating a PDF Report

On the *Base Assets* list there is a feature that allows you to generate a PDF list of selected assets. This PDF list serves as a printer-friendly or email-friendly version of your asset list, which can be provided to a broker or used for stocktaking.

## Generating a PDF list of Selected Assets

1. Navigate to the Assets page by clicking on **Assets** &gt; **Assets** in the explorer side bar.
