# Registration Expiry and Service Reminders

Built into the Assetâ€™s module is a feature that automatically assigns user tasks for an upcoming service date, or registration expiry. This ensures that assets are properly maintained, and their registrations remain up-to-date.

To receive reminders for a service date or registration expiry, simply ensure that the *Next Service Date* or *Registration Expiry* fields on the asset are filled with a future date.

The reminder task will be generated one month prior to the date selected in the fields labelled *Next Service Date* or *Registration Expiry*. The reminder task will be assigned to the *Asset Management Group*. Any user who is a member of that group will receive the task: e.g. "Renew Registration for Vehicle 000001".
