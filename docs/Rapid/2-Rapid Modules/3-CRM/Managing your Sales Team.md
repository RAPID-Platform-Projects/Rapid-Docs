# Managing your Sales Team

The **Sales Team** is a group role that come preconfigured as part of the CRM module. This means that users within the system can be assigned to the Sales Team. As a result, any tasks assigned to the Sales Team will appear in the “My Tasks” view for those users.

This allows the Sales Team to easily have visibility of all of their tasks and anyone within the team can pick up the tasks as they come in
