# Project Financials Tab

The **Project Financials** tab is a helpful place to access all budgets, quotes, and invoices associated with the project.

Budgets are found under the scoping tab and under the financials tab. Both locations show the same items but are accessible in two locations depending if the user is **Scoping** the project or trying to access the **Financials**.
