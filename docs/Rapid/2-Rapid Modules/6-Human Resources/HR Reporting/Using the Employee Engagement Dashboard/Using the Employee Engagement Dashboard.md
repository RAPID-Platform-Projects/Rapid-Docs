# Using the Employee Engagement Dashboard

As part of the **HR** module, you are provided with an Out-Of-The-Box Employee Engagement Dashboard. This allows the HR team to quickly see the engagement and loyalty of staff by department based on the eNPS Score. (See [Employee Engagement Process](</docs/Rapid/2-Rapid Modules/6-Human Resources/employees/employee-engagement-process/employee-engagement-process.md>) for a breakdown of the eNPS score and what it means).

## Accessing the Employee Engagement Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Human Resources** &gt; **HR Reporting**

### Slicers

Slicers provides the user with the ability to filter all of the visuals on the page by a specific attribute. They can be found at the top of the page.

The Employee Engagement Report can be “sliced” based on no attributes, one attribute, or multiple attributes. The attributes available to “slice” by are **Year**, **eNPS Category**, and **Department**.
