# Birthday and Work Anniversary Reminders

Within the **HR** module, we have incorporated two methods to stay informed about upcoming employee birthdays and work anniversaries. The first method involves email reminders, which are detailed on this page. The second option is the birthday and work anniversary calendar, which are elaborated upon [here](<docs\Rapid\2-Rapid Standard\6-Human Resources\HR Reporting\using-the-hr-calendar\using-the-hr-calendar.md>).

Email reminders are a convenient way to automatically be reminded of any upcoming employee birthdays or work anniversaries. This feature serves as a valuable tool for managers, enabling them to recognise and celebrate their employees. The reminder email is sent to the employeeâ€™s direct manager.

To receive reminders for employee birthdays and work anniversaries, the following fields are required: **Manager**, **DOB** and **Start Date**. The **Manager** field specifies who the reminders are sent to via email, while the **DOB** and **Work Start Date** fields are used to determine the next birthday, and next work anniversary, respectively.

Should a manager prefer not to receive email reminders, they can turn off **Birthday Reminders** and **Work Anniversary Reminders** if desired.

## Opting-Out of Receiving Employee Birthday and Work Anniversary Reminders

As a manager, you will receive birthday and work anniversary reminders from any employees that you directly manage, by default. To switch off these reminders, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Human Resources** &gt; **Employees**
