# Employees

The Employees table provides a place for you to list all your past and current employees, and is designed to be your business's Source of Truth when it comes to employee records.

This table has many built in fields relating to employees, from postal address, emergency contact information, and the employee's role. You can also store employee documents against the record, such as their Superannuation confirmation, or other vital information.
