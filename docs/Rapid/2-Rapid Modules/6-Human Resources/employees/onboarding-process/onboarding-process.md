# Onboarding Process

The Rapid **HR** module includes an onboarding process to help streamline the collection and validation of new employee information, and provide an opportunity to send them policy documents. (See [Assigning an employee a policy through the onboarding process](</docs/Rapid/2-Rapid Modules/7-Policies/2-Assigning-an-employee-employees-to-complete-a-policy/2-Assigning-an-employee-employees-to-complete-a-policy.md>)).

This process also provides a great opportunity to customise the system to your business needs. Do you want to add an IT onboarding item to the process, or a Workplace Health and Safety process? Contact your Rapid representative to explore the customisability options.

## Triggers

The onboarding process is triggered on the creation of an employee and creates two tasks.

## Summary

Below is a summary of the onboarding process.

1. The process will automatically email the employee with a form for them to add or confirm their details including: 
    1. **Name** and **Contact Details**
    2. **Address** and **Postal Address**
    3. **Banking** details
    4. **Emergency Contact** details

2. If policies were selected for the employee to read and acknowledge, the process will send these as an email with links to each of the policy documents. The email will also contain a form for the employee to confirm that they have read each of the policies.
