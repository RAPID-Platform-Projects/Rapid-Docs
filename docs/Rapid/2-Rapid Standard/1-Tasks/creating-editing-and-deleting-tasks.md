4. Enter the relevant details. Note: The “Assigned To” column will determine whose task list this will appear in. You can assign a task to a “Role” such as “WHS Team” and any members of that team will see the task in their task list on the “My Tasks” view.

## Deletion
It is not recommended to delete a Task if it has been abandoned; instead, change its status to "Aborted".

However, if you need to delete a task due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple Tasks at once.
