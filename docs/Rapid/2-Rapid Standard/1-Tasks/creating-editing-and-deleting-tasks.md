## Completing a Task

### Changing the "Status" Choice Field

Each task in Rapid contains a Choice field labelled "Status". To complete a task:

1. Open a **Task** in [Explorer](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/0-navigating-explorer/0-navigating-explorer.md>)

2. Click on the **Status** field to open its dropdown menu.

3. Select **Completed**

4. **Save** your changes

### Using the Complete Action Button

When viewing an Item's page, there will be an additional button in the [Command Bar](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/glossary/glossary.md#command-bar>) labelled "Complete". This button has an icon of a checkmark.

Pressing this button will set the **Status** choice field to "Completed", and will also save your changes.

## Deleting a Task
It is not recommended to delete a Task if it has been abandoned; instead, change its status to "Aborted".

However, if you need to delete a task due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple Tasks at once.
