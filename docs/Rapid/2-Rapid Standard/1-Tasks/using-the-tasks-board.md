# Using the Tasks Board
## Overview
The task board is a great way to visualise the status of each of the project’s sub-tasks. It also provides the user the ability to easily move tasks between each of the status fields which will automatically update the status of that task. Moreover, the “view” can be changed to show tasks on the task board that are only your tasks or “All” tasks depending if you want visibility of your responsibilities or the tasks from the project as a whole.

## Accessing the Task Board

## Changing the View
The default view on the Task Board is the “My Tasks – All” view which shows all tasks assigned to the user or a group the user is a part of. This view can be changed to the “All” view to show all tasks in the project irrespective of who it is assigned to. To do this follow the steps below.

1. On the sidebar select Tasks > Task Portal
