# Using the Tasks Board

## Overview
The task board is a great way to visualise the status of each of the project’s sub-tasks. It also provides the user the ability to easily move tasks between each of the status fields which will automatically update the status of that task. Moreover, the “view” can be changed to show tasks on the task board that are only your tasks or “All” tasks depending if you want visibility of your responsibilities or the tasks from the project as a whole.

## Accessing the Task Board
1. On the sidebar select **Tasks** > **Task Portal**

## Moving Items between status categories

1. Click and drag the task between columns (this will update the status of the task from the column it started on to the column you “drop” it in)

## Changing the View
The default view on the Task Board is the “My Tasks – All” view which shows all tasks assigned to the user or a group the user is a part of. This view can be changed to the “All” view to show all tasks in the project irrespective of who it is assigned to. To do this follow the steps below.

1. Click on the dropdown in the upper right corner above the task board which says “My Tasks – All”
