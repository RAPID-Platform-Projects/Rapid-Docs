# Base Assets and Subtypes

In Base RAPID, there are three types of assets: Assets, IT Assets, and Vehicles.

### Base Assets

This list includes generalisable columns that are applicable to various asset classes. It can be used to store different types of assets, ranging from office furniture, to chemicals, or books. This list is suitable for cases where custom columns are not required and using the basic asset columns is sufficient.

The Base Assets list also serves as a comprehensive record of all assets. If an asset is created in the IT Assets table or the Vehicles Table, it will also be displayed in the Base Assets table. However, if an asset is created in the Asset table, it will not appear in the IT Assets table or the Vehicles Table.

### IT Assets

This list encompasses all the columns from the Assets table, along with additional IT-specific columns, such as serial number or IMEI. Any items created in this table will also be visible in the Base Assets table.

### Vehicles

This list includes all the columns from the Assets table, along with additional columns specific to vehicles, such as insurance details and VIN number. Any items created in this table will also be displayed in the Base Assets table.
