# Creating, Editing, or Deleting Assets

Creating, editing, or deleting assets is the same process for each of the three table types.

## Creating an Asset

1. On the Explorer sidebar, click **Assets** &gt; **Assets**

The user has then pressed the "Assets" table button, which has an icon of three list items.](<Navigating to Assets.png>)

2. Navigate to the desired table using the tabs (Assets, IT Assets, or Vehicles)

3. Click on **New Asset** (or **New IT Asset** or **New Vehicle**)

The screenshot is annotated with a red box to highlight the location of the buttons: "New IT Asset" (which has an icon of a robot arm), "New Vehicle" (which has an icon of a car), and "New Asset" (which has an icon of a box with confetti inside).](<New asset creation menu.png>)

4. Enter all relevant details. (To maintain good bookkeeping practices, it is recommended to enter as much information as possible).
    
    - For **Vehicle Assets**: *Registration Expiry* and *Next Service Date* are required fields if you wish to receive Registration and Service reminders

    - For **IT Assets**: *Next Service Date* is a required field if you want to receive service reminders  

5. Click on **Create** or **Create and Open**

The following fields are visible: Name, Employee, Make, Model, Serial Number, Condition, Manufactured Date, and Status. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to highlight the "Create" and "Create and Open" buttons at the top of the create screen.](<New Asset Details.png>)

## Editing Assets

1. Find the **Asset Item** you wish to edit (you can locate an asset either by scrolling through the list, or using the search bar)

The screenshot is annotated with two red boxes: the first one indicates that the user has searched for the phrase "standing", to filter the table results to only show items that contain this word in their searchable columns. The second red box highlights an item row that the user is hovering over.](<Open the asset.png>)

2. Open the **Asset Item** by:
    - Clicking once on the title field of the item (this is the column with **bold** text)
    - Double-clicking on the item row

3. Edit any relevant fields on the **Asset Page** as needed

4. Click on **Save** or **Save and Close**

## Deleting Assets

It is not recommended to delete an asset if it is no longer in use; instead, change its status to "inactive." This way, you can maintain a list of all your current and past assets.

However, if you need to delete an asset due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple assets at once.

### Deleting Assets via a Data Table

1. Select the asset(s) you wish to delete by pressing their selection circles.

:::note[Selection Circles]
The selection circles do not appear until the mouse cursor overs over the space that they occupy.

2. Press the **Delete** button

The button's text reads: "Delete 2 Assets", because two assets have been selected in the data table below. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to highlight the location of the delete button.](<Delete the selected assets.png>)

### Deleting Assets via an Item Page

1. Open the asset you wish to edit (you can locate an asset either by scrolling through the list, or using the search bar)
