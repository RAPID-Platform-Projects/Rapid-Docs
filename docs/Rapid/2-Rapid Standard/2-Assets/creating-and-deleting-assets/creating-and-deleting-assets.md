### How to Delete an Asset (Asset, IT Asset, Vehicle)

It is not recommended to delete an asset if it is no longer in use; instead, change its status to "inactive." This way, you can maintain a list of all your current and past assets.

However, if you need to delete an asset due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple assets at once.

**Deleting from the list:**

1. On the Explorer sidebar, click **Assets** &gt; **Assets**  

    ![Navigating to assets](<Navigating to Assets.png>)

2. Navigate to the desired table using the tabs (Assets, IT Assets, Vehicles)  

    ![Navigate to asset type](<Navigate to asset type.png>)

3. Select the asset(s) you wish to delete

    ![Selecting multiple assets](<Selecting multiple assets.png>)

4. Press the **Delete** button 

    ![Delete the selected assets](<Delete the selected assets.png>)

**Deleting from the asset page:**

1. On the Explorer sidebar, click **Assets** &gt; **Assets**

    ![Navigating to assets](<Navigating to Assets.png>)

2. Navigate to the desired table using the tabs (Assets, IT Assets, Vehicles)

    ![Navigate to asset type](<Navigate to asset type.png>)

3. Open the asset you wish to edit (you can locate an asset either by scrolling through the list, or using the search bar)  

    ![Open the asset](<Open the asset.png>)

4. Click on the **Delete** button  

    ![Delete the asset from the details page](<Delete the asset from the details page.png>)

**Note:** When deleting assets from the base *Assets List*, their entries on the subtype tables (i.e., *IT Assets* or *Vehicles*) will also be deleted, and vice versa.
