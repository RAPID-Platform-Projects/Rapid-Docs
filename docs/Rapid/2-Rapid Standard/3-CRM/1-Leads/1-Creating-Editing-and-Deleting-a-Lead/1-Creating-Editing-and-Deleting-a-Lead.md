# Creating, Editing, and Deleting a Lead

    - Clicking once on the title field of the item. *(The title field will appear in **bold** text).*
    - Double-clicking anywhere on the item's row

## Deleting Leads

It is not recommended to delete a lead if it is lost; instead, change its status to **Lost**. This way, you can maintain a list of all your leads and determine a conversion rate.

However, if you need to delete a lead due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple leads at once.

### Deleting Multiple Leads via the Leads Table

1. Select the Lead(s) you wish to delete by pressing their selection circles
