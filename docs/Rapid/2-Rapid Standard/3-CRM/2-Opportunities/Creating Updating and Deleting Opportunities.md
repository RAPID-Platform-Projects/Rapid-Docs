# Creating, Editing, and Deleting Opportunities

An "opportunity" refers to a potential sales deal or a potential revenue-generating event for a business. It represents a specific potential transaction with a customer or client.

The **Opportunities** table provides a place for the sales team to store and keep track of all opportunities. The [Sales Dashboard](</docs/Rapid/2-Rapid Standard/3-CRM/5-CRM Reporting/5-Sales Dashboard.md>) derives the majority of its information from the records on the **Opportunities** table.

## Creating an Opportunity

**Opportunities** can be created in two ways. The first is through the [Lead conversion button](</docs/Rapid/2-Rapid Standard/3-CRM/1-Leads/3-Converting-a-Lead/3-Converting-a-Lead.md>), which automatically creates an **Opportunity** with the relevant lead details. The second way is to create a new item manually:

1. In the **Explorer Sidebar** select **CRM** &gt; **Opportunities**

The user has then pressed the "Assets" table button, which has an icon of three list items.](<Opportunities Sidebar.png>)

2. Select **New Opportunity**

3. Enter the relevant details. (Be sure to enter data into all required fields).

4. Press **+ Create** or **Create and Open**

The opportunity fields are filled in as follows: "Opportunity Name: Smith's Card Yard", "Account: Smith's Card Yard", "Opportunity Manager: Sales Team", "Estimated Value: $10000", Probability of success: "80%", "Estimated Close Date: Sat Jun 01 2024", "Status: Qualified", "Contacts: Bob Smith", "Description: Ad campaign for new cash incentive."](<Opportunity Create Screen.png>)

## Editing an Opportunity

1. Open the **Opportunity** you wish to edit. (Locate the **Opportunity** either by scrolling through the list or using the search bar).

2. Edit any relevant fields on the **Opportunity** as needed. 

3. Once you have finished editing, click on Save or Save and Close.

## Deleting Opportunities

It is not recommended to delete an **Opportunity** instead change its status to **Closed Lost**. This way, you can maintain a list of all your opportunities.

However, if you need to delete an **Opportunity** due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple **Opportunities** at once.

### Deleting Multiple Opportunities

1. Select the Opportunities you wish to delete

2. Click on **Delete X Opportunities** button

The button has a red icon of a trash can and a red label that reads: "Delete 5 Opportunities" because there are five items selected. The screenshot is annotated with a red box that highlights the location of the "Delete" button.](<Delete multiple Opportunities.png>)

### Deleting a Single Opportunity

1. Open the **Opportunity** you wish to delete. (Locate the **Opportunity** either by scrolling through the list or using the search bar).
