# Creating, Editing, and Deleting Opportunities

### Overview

An "opportunity" refers to a potential sales deal or a potential revenue-generating event for a business. It represents a specific potential transaction with a customer or client.

The Opportunities table provides a place for the sales team to store and keep track of all Opportunities. The Sales Dashboard (described [here](<../5-CRM Reporting/5-Sales Dashboard.md>)) derives the majority of its information from the records on the Opportunities table.

### How to create an Opportunity

Opportunities can be created in two ways. The first is through the Lead conversion button, where an Opportunity will automatically be created with the relevant lead details (More information on this method can be found here: [Converting a Lead](../1-Leads/3-Converting-a-Lead/3-Converting-a-Lead.md)). The second way, like many other items is through the Opportunity list page and those steps can be found below.

### Deleting Opportunities

It is not recommended to delete an **Opportunity** instead change its status to **Closed Lost**. This way, you can maintain a list of all your opportunities.

However, if you need to delete an **Opportunity** due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple **Opportunities** at once.
