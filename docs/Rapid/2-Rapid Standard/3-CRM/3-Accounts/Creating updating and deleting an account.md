# Creating, Editing, and Deleting an Account

Accounts represent the various businesses that your organisation interacts with, whether a supplier or customer.

## Creating an Account

Accounts can be created via two methods. The first is through the [Lead conversion button](</docs/Rapid/2-Rapid Standard/3-CRM/1-Leads/3-Converting-a-Lead/3-Converting-a-Lead.md>), where an Account will automatically be created with the relevant lead details. The second method, like many other items is through the table list page and those steps can be found below.

## Deleting Accounts

It is not recommended to delete an **Account** instead change its status to **Inactive**. This way, you can maintain a list of all your accounts, and reinstate them as **Active** if they come back as a customer or supplier.

However, if you need to delete an **Account** due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple **Accounts** at once.

### Deleting Multiple Accounts

1. Select the **Accounts** you wish to delete by ticking the boxes or by clicking and dragging to select multiple items.

2. Click on the **Delete X Accounts** button  

![A screenshot to demonstrate a user selecting multiple items. The screenshot is annotated with two red boxes. The first box highlights the "Delete 2 Accounts" button, which states this because two items have been selected. The second red box highlights that two items have been selected by the user, and a third item is about to be selected.](<Delete Account Multiple.png>)

### Deleting a Single Account

1. Open the **Account** item you wish to delete. (Locate the **Account** either by scrolling through the list or using the search bar).  

2. Press **Delete**
