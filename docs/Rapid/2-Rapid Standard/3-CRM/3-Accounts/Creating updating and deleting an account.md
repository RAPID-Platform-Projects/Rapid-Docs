# Creating, Editing, and Deleting an Account

### Overview

Accounts represent the various businesses that your organisation interacts with, whether a supplier or customer.

### How to create an Account

Accounts can be created via two methods. The first is through the Lead conversion button, where an Account will automatically be created with the relevant lead details (More information on this method can be found here: [Converting a Lead](../1-Leads/3-Converting-a-Lead/3-Converting-a-Lead.md)). The second method, like many other items is through the table list page and those steps can be found below.

1. In Explorer select CRM &gt; Accounts  

    ![Navigate to Accounts](<Navigate to Accounts.png>)

2. Select **New Account** 

    ![Create new Account](<Create new Account.png>)

### Deleting Accounts

It is not recommended to delete an **Account** instead change its status to **Inactive**. This way, you can maintain a list of all your accounts, and reinstate them as **Active** if they come back as a customer or supplier.

However, if you need to delete an **Account** due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple **Accounts** at once.

#### How to delete multiple Accounts at once

1. In Explorer select CRM &gt; Accounts  

    ![Navigate to Accounts](<Navigate to Accounts.png>)

2. Select the Accounts you wish to delete by ticking the boxes or by clicking and dragging to select multiple.

3. Click on the **Delete X Accounts** button

#### How to delete a single Account from the Accounts page
