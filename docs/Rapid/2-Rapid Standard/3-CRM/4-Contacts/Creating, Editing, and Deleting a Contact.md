# Creating, Editing, and Deleting a Contact

### Overview

A "contact" typically refers to a person with whom you or your business have some form of communication or connection.

Contacts can be created without an associated lead. This is done in the same way as any list item is created. See the general “Creating, Editing, and Deleting” items documentation.

### Deleting Contacts

It is not recommended to delete a Contact if no longer active; instead, change its status to **Archived**. This way, you can maintain a list of all your Contacts, and always reinstate a Contact to **Active** if needed.

However, if you need to delete a Contact due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple Contacts at once.

#### How to delete multiple Contacts from the Contacts list page

1. Navigate to the Contacts table via CRM &gt; Contacts.  

    ![Navigate to Contacts](<Side bar navigate to Contacts.png>)

2. Select the Contacts you wish to delete by ticking the boxes or by clicking and dragging to select multiple. 

3. Click on the **Delete X Contacts** button.
