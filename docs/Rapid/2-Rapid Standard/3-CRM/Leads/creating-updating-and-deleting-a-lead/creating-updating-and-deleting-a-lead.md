# Creating, Updating, and Deleting a Lead

### Overview

Unlike Assets, Leads does not have a base-type / sub-type structure. This makes Deleting, Accessing and Viewing Leads simpler.

### Deleting Leads

It is not recommended to delete a lead if it is lost; instead, change its status to **Lost**. This way, you can maintain a list of all your leads and determine a conversion rate.

However, if you need to delete a lead due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple leads at once.

#### How to delete multiple leads at once
