# Creating, Updating, and Deleting Opportunities

### Overview

The opportunities table provides a place for the sales team to store and keep track of any potential projects and sales. The Sales Dashboard (described [here](../CRM%20Reporting/sales-dashboard/sales-dashboard.md)) derives the majority of its information from the records on the opportunities table.

### How to Create an Opportunity

Opportunities can be created in two ways. The first is through the Lead conversion button, where it will automatically be created with the relevant lead details (More information on this method can be found here: [Converting a Lead](../Leads/converting-a-lead/converting-a-lead.md)). The second way, like many other tables is through the table list page and those steps can be found below.

1. In Explorer select CRM &gt; Sales &gt; Opportunities  
    ![Navigate to Opportunities](<Side bar navigate to Opportunities.png>)
2. Select ****New Opportunity**** 
    ![Create new Opportinity](<Create new Opportunity.png>)

### Deleting Opportunities

It is not recommended to delete an **Opportunity** instead change its status to **Closed Lost**. This way, you can maintain a list of all your opportunities.

However, if you need to delete an **Opportunity** due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple **Opportunities** at once.

#### How to delete multiple opportunities at once
