## Deleting a Payment Item

Deleting a payment works differently than deleting other items in Rapid as we only offer the ability to “soft” delete these items. This means the record is retained in the system but the status is changed to *DELETED*. Follow the steps below to do so.

1. Navigate to the **Finance** &gt; **Bills**

The screenshot is annotated with red boxes to highlight where the user has clicked.](</docs/Rapid/2-Rapid Standard/4-Finance/3-Bills/Creating Editing and Deleting Bills/navigate-to-bills.png>)

2. Locate the bill you wish to add a payment against either by scrolling through the list or using the search bar.

In the screenshot, the user has searched for "18" in the search filter, and this has produced an item at the top of the list that reads: "BILL - 00000018". Both the search filter and the title of the bill that has been found are annotated with a red box to draw the reader's attention to them.](</docs/Rapid/2-Rapid Standard/4-Finance/3-Bills/Creating Editing and Deleting Bills/navigate-to-desired-bill.png>)
