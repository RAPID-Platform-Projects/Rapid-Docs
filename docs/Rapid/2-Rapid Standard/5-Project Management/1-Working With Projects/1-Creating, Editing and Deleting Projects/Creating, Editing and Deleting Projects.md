## How to Edit a Project (along with the Objectives, Deliverables, Risks, Exclusions, and Budgets)

It is not recommended to delete a project instead, change its status to **Aborted**. This way you can maintain a record of all projects.

However, if you need to delete a project due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so.

However, deleting the project will not delete the subitems (Objectives, Deliverables, Risks, and Budgets) that are part of that project. If you wish to delete the sub-items along with the Project follow the steps below.
