# Creating and Editing Tasks Within a Project

## Overview

All projects must incorporate a list of tasks, outlining the activities necessary for achieving project objectives. It is essential to regularly update the tasks list throughout the project's lifecycle to maintain an accurate record of completed and outstanding tasks.

Both the **Tasks Board** and **Gantt Chart** components accurately represent the data from the project's task list.

There are three ways to create tasks in the context of a project: from the **Tasks List**, the **Tasks Board**, or from the **Gantt Chart**.

- The *Start Date* and *Due Date* is what the Gantt Chart uses to display the task.
- The *Assigned To* column will determine whose task list this will appear in. You can assign a task to a *Role* such as **WHS Team** and any members of that team will see the task in their task list on the **My Tasks** view.
