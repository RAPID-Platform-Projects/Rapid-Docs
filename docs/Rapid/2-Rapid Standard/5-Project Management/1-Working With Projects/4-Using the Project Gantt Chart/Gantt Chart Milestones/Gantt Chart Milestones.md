## Milestones

**Gantt** milestones are significant points or achievements within a project that are represented as a distinct marker to highlight key project events or goals. Milestones can be used to represent: critical points, progress tracking, and decision points.

By incorporating milestones into a Gantt chart, project managers can enhance project visibility, facilitate effective communication, and better manage and track the project's progress towards key objectives.

It is important to note that while tasks cover a date range, milestones represent a point in time.

### Creating Milestones

1. Navigate to a Project's Gantt Chart by doing the following:
    - Navigate to **Projects** &gt; **Projects**.
    - Open a **Project** item. You can find this project by either scrolling through the list or using the search bar.  
    - Click on the **Project Management** tab  
    - Click on the **Gantt** tab
