# Using the Project Gantt Chart

## Overview

The Project Gantt Chart is a useful visual for Project Management to visualise the steps required to complete the project and where in that sequence of events the project is currently at. Moreover, the tasks that the Gantt chart is comprised of can be edited directly from the visual. Where the “Start Date” and “Finish Date” of each task can be adjusted by simply dragging the length of the item.

## How to access a Project's Gantt Chart

1. Navigate to **Projects** &gt; **Projects**

## How to create Finish-to-Start Dependencies on a Project Gantt Chart

A Gantt chart dependency is a relationship between two or more tasks in a project that dictates the sequence in which they must be executed. Dependencies illustrate the order and timing of task completion, outlining the relationships that exist between different project activities. A Finish-to-Start dependency is the most common type, where the start of one task depends on the completion of another. Task B cannot begin until Task A finishes. Follow the steps below to create Finish-to-Start Dependencies:

1. Navigate to **Projects** &gt; **Projects**  

    ![A screenshot showing how to navigate to the projects table](./downloaded_image_1705286190152.png)

2. Open the Project you wish to view the Gantt of. Find this project by either scrolling through the list or using the search bar.  

    ![A screenshot showing how to open the desired project from the projects table](./downloaded_image_1705286191168.png)

3. Click on the **Project Management** tab 

    ![A screenshot showing the location of the project management tab in the context of the project item](./downloaded_image_1705286192178.png)

4. Click on the **Gantt**  

    ![A screenshot showing the location of the Gantt tab so that the user can open the related Gantt chart.](./downloaded_image_1705286193192.png)

5. Identify the task you wish to create a dependency from (Task A) and the task to you wish to create a dependency to (Task B)
6. Hover your cursor over Task A, you will notice a white circle appear at the end of this task. Click and drag your cursor to the white circle at the start of Task B.

7. This results in the Task B start date shifted to the Task A End date. There is logic to accommodate non-work days.

8. Press **Save X Items**

## Milestones

Gantt milestones are significant points or achievements within a project that are represented as a distinct marker to highlight key project events or goals. Milestones can be used to represent: critical points, progress tracking, and decision points.

By incorporating milestones into a Gantt chart, project managers can enhance project visibility, facilitate effective communication, and better manage and track the project's progress towards key objectives.

It is important to note that while tasks cover a date range, milestones represent a point in time.
