# Project Management
Projects represent a large piece of work that groups together a number of tasks, often executed by more than one person. Projects can also be internal, or executed for clients.

The projects table provides a place for you to access all of your organisationâ€™s projects, both past and present. 

Projects are made up of many items, including the project itself, as well as other linked items such as: Objectives, Deliverables, Risks, Exclusions, Budgets, Quotes, and Invoices. All of these are neatly contained within the project item to streamline your work.
