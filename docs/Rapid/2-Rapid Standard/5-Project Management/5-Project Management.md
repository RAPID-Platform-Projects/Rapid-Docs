The **Projects** module represent a large piece of work that groups together a number of tasks, often executed by more than one person. Projects can be internal, or executed for clients.

Projects are made up of many items, including the project itself, are linked to other items such as:
- Objectives
- Deliverables
- Risks
- Exclusions
- Budgets
- Quotes
- Invoices

All of these are neatly contained within the project item to streamline your work.
