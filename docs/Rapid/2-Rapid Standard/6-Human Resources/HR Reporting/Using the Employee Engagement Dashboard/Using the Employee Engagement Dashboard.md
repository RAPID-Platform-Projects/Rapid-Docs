# Using the Employee Engagement Dashboard

### Overview

As part of the HR module, you are provided with an Out-Of-The-Box Employee Engagement Dashboard. This allows the HR team to quickly see the engagement and loyalty of staff by department based on the eNPS Score. (See [Employee Engagement Process](/docs/Rapid/2-Rapid Standard/6-Human Resources/Employees/employee-engagement-process/employee-engagement-process.md) for a breakdown of the eNPS score and what it means).

### How to Access the Employee Engagement Dashboard

### Using the Employee Engagement Dashboard

#### Slicers

Slicers provides the user with the ability to filter all of the visuals on the page by a specific attribute. They can be found at the top of the page.

The Employee Engagement Report can be “sliced” based on no attributes, one attribute, or multiple attributes. The attributes available to “slice” by are **Year**, **eNPS Cateogry**, and **Department**.

### Questionnaires Sent and Responses Received

This section of the report contains two subsections: *Cards* and the *Questionnaires Sent vs Responses Received* graph.

##### Cards

The *Cards* section within the *Questionnaires Sent and Responses Received* section offers concise reference statistics. The values of these cards will change based on the slicers.

The provided cards are as follows:

- *Count Sent* – Indicates the number of *Employee Engagement Questionnaires* sent. (This can be sliced by **Year**).
- *Count Responses* – Represents the count of the responses received (Can be sliced by **Year**, and **Department**).
- *Response Rate* – The percentage of responses based on the count sent.

##### Questionnaires Sent vs Responses Received Graph

The *Questionnaires Sent vs Responses Received* graph is a simple visual that shows the number of questionnaires sent and the number of responses received through time at a month level.

It is also possible to change the unit of time from “Month” to “Year”. To do this simply click on the “Drill Up” arrow on the top right of the visual. To move back from the “Year” view to the “Month” view click on the “Drill Down” button and select the year you wish to drill down to.
