# Using the HR Calendar

The **HR Calendar** provides the HR team with a dynamic calendar of employee's birthdays, work anniversaries, probation review dates, and performance review dates. The report is comprised of two sections, the *Slicers*, and *Calendar Sections*.

Did you want to customise the calendar to show other important dates? This is possible with Rapid's flexibility. Contact a Rapid representative to find out more details.

## Accessing the HR Calendar

### Slicers

Slicers provides the user with the ability to filter the calendar by: **Department**, **Employee**, or **Type**. This means that if you only want to see birthdays for the “Sales Department” you can set the “Department” slicer to “Sales”, and the “Type” slicer to “Birthday”.
