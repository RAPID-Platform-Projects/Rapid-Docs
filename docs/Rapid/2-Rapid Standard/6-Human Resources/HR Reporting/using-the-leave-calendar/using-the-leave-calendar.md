# Using the Leave Calendar

### Overview

The *Leave Calendar* provides the HR team with a dynamic calendar of employee leave requests. It is a single place to easily see your employee's planned leave. The report is comprised of two sections, the *Slicers*, and *Calendar Sections*.

If you want to customise the calendar to show other important dates, this is possible with Rapid's flexibility. Contact Rapid to find out more details.

### Using the Leave Calendar

#### Slicers

Slicers provides the user with the ability to filter the calendar by: **Departments**, **Employee**, or **Approval Status**. This means that if you only want to see approved leave requests for the “Sales Department” you can set the **Department** slicer to “Sales” and the **Approval Status** slicer to “Approved”.
