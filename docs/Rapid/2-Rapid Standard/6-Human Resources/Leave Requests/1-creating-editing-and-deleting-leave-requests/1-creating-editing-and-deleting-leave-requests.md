# Creating, Editing, and Deleting Leave Requests

## Creating a Leave Request

Leave requests can be created in two ways: through a public form and through the leaves request table in explorer

### Creating a Leave Request through a Public Form

1. Open the public form on a phone or computer via a QR code or URL. (This link should be disseminated to non-users in a way that makes sense given the organizational context. i.e A link on user desktops, an email with the link, or physical QR code papers in the office. If you are the Site Administrator, see the following LINK for how to access the Leave Request URL and QR code.)

2. The following fields are required: *Employee, Type, Hours, Start Date*, and *Finish Date*. 
    - *Comments* are optional and will appear in the mangers leave request approval task.

3. Click **Submit**

## Editing a Leave Request

If you are taking advantage of the “Leave Request Approval” process it is NOT recommended to edit a leave request, cause discrepancies between what the manager approved and was communicated to employees and what the changes suggests.

In the case that you may not be using the Leave Request Approval process in your system you can edit leave requests by following the steps below:

1. Navigate to the leave requests table by clicking on the **Human Resources** &gt; **Leave Requests**.

## Deleting Leave Requests

It is not recommended to delete a leave request. Instead, change the **Approved** toggle to "No".

However, if you need to delete a leave request due to a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list, or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple leave requests at once.

### Deleting Multiple Leave Requests from the List Page

1. Navigate to **Human Resources** &gt; **Leave Requests
