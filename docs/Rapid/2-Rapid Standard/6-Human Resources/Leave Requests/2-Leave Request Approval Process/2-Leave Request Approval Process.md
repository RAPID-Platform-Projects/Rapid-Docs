# Leave Request Approval Process

Rapid Standard is packaged with a **Leave Request Approval Process**. This process automatically assigns tasks to the direct manager of the leave requester. The process then sends correspondence as to the outcome of the leave request decision, along with comments from the manager. 

If leave is approved, the manager will receive a reminder email one week before the employee goes on leave.

## Triggers

The process is triggered in two ways:

1. **Public Form Trigger:** Through the creation of a leave request via the public form

2. **Rapid Explorer Triggers:** Through the creation of the leave request through Rapid Explorer

## Process Summary

Once triggered, the Leave Request Process follows the following stages:

1. **Approve / Reject Leave Request:** The direct manager of the employee will receive a task to either *Approve* or *Reject* the leave request. The direct manager can leave comments, which will be sent to the employee in the correspondence stage. By default, receiving reminders is enabled. If the manager does not wish to receive a reminder, they can change the **Receive Reminders** toggle to "No".

2. **Send Employee Leave Approved / Unapproved Email:** Following the manager's assessment, an email will be sent to the employee stating the manager's decision on the leave (Approved or Unapproved). Additionally, they will receive the other details of the leave request (*Start Date*, *Finish Date*, and *Manager Comments*). If the leave request not approved, the process ends following this communication

3. **Manager Reminder**: If the leave request is approved, the manager will receive a reminder email stating the details of the leave request one week before the leave request's start date.
