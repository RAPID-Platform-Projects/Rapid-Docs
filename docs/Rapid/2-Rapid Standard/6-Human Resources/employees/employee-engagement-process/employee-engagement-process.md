# Employee Engagement Process (eNPS Questionnaire)

### Overview

As part of Rapid Standard comes a questionnaire process to be able to get regular feedback from employees and calculate an employee Net Promotor Score (eNPS).

This is a method of quantifying employee loyalty and satisfaction and is gathered by asking one simple question: “On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend this company as a good place to work to your friends or families”. From this question the percentage of “detractors”(those who answer 0 to 6), “neutrals” (those who answer 7 or 8), and “promotors” (those who answer 9 or 10) are calculated.

Finally, the eNPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detracts from promotors. This results in a score between -100 and 100. A good eNPS score depends on the industry and the context, but generally, scores between 10 and 30 are considered good, while scores between 50 and 70 are considered excellent.

### Additional Details

This will send an email with a link to a form to each selected employees. Employee responses to this form will be anonymous. There are only two questions on the form:

1. Select your department (Employees are required to select which department they are from this helps to produce a eNPS score by department and the organisation as a whole)
2. On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend this company as a good place to work to your friends or families (This is used to calculate the eNPS score)
