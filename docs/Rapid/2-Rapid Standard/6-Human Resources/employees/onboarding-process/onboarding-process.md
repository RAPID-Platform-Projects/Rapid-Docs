# Onboarding Process

### Overview

The Rapid HR module includes an onboarding process, to help streamline the collection and validation of new employee information and provide an opportunity to send them policy document (See the “Assigning an employee a policy through the onboarding process” page). This process also provides a great opportunity to customise the system to your business needs. Do you want to add an IT onboarding item to the process or a Workplace Health and Safety process? Contact your Rapid representative to explore the customisability options.
