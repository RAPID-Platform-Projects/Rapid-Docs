# Using the Employee Engagement Dashboard

### Overview

As part of the HR module, you are provided with an Out-Of-The-Box Employee Engagement Dashboard. This allows the HR team to quickly see the engagement and loyalty of staff by department based on the eNPS Score (See [Employee Engagement Process](/docs/Rapid/2-Rapid%20Standard/6-Human%20Resources/employees/employee-engagement-process/employee-engagement-process.md) for a breakdown of the eNPS score and what it means).

### How to Access the Employee Engagement Dashboard

### Using the Employee Engagement Dashboard

#### Slicers

Slicers provides the user with the ability to filter all of the visuals on the page by a specific attribute and can be found at the top of the page.

The Employee Engagement Report can be “sliced” based on no attributes, one attribute, or multiple attributes. The attributes available to “slice” by are Month, Year, and Department.

For example, you could use the slicers to filter down the visuals to 2024 for the Finance department.
