### Using the HR Dashboard

#### Slicers

Slicers provides the user with the ability to filter all the visuals on the page by a specific attribute and can be found at the top of the page.

The HR Dashboard can be sliced based on no attributes, one attribute, or multiple attributes. The attributes available to “slice” by are Department, Role, Employee, Status, and Year – Month.

For example, you could use the slicers to filter down the visuals Employees in the Sales department that are On Probation.

#### Employee Headcount Changes Visual

The "Employee Headcount Changes" visual displays the number of new hires and departures over time. This visual is interactive meaning that clicking on a specific point on the graph will filter down all the other visuals to the data that relates to that specific time range. For example, clicking on the Employee Headcount Column above September will filter down the other visuals to the specific employees that make up that column.

It is also possible to change the unit of time from “Month” to “Year”. To do this simply click on the “Drill Up” arrow on the top right of the visual. To move back from the “Year” view to the “Month” view click on the “Drill Down” button and select the year you wish to drill down to.
