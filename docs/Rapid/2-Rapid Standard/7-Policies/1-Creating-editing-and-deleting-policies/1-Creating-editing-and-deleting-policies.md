## Deleting a policy

It is not recommended to delete a policy instead, change its status to *Archived*. This way you can maintain a record of past and current policies.

However, if you need to delete a policy due to incorrect data entry or a duplicate entry, you can do so in two ways: from the list or from the item page. Deleting from the list allows you to delete multiple policies at once.

### Deleting Multiple Policies from the Policy List

1. Navigate to **Human Resources** &gt; **Policies**

2. Select the policies you wish to delete
