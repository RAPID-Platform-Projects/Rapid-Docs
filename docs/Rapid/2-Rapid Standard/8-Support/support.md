# Support Module

The support module allows your organisation to take requests from clients, customers, or employees. The support module provides a form to submit requests, the data structures to easily edit and manage requests, and a process that will assign tasks to the people deemed responsible for requests. All the while keeping the original requester informed with confirmation and update emails.
