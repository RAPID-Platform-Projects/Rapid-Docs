The Incidents report is divided into four sections: slicers, charts, cards, and the Incidents table.

### Slicers
Slicers provides the user with the ability to filter all of the visuals on the page by a specific attribute and can be found at the top of the page. 

The Incidents report can be “sliced” based on no attributes, one attribute, or multiple attributes. The attributes available to slice by on the support dashboard are: Year, Department Name, and Status

### Cards
The Cards section within the Incidents report offers concise reference statistics. The values of these cards will change based on the slicers or if selections are made on table or charts.
The provided cards are as follows: 

- **Number of Requests** – Displays the total number of requests
- **\# of Unclosed Requests** – Displays the number requests where the status is not “Resolved” or “Cancelled”
- **\# of Closed Requests** – Displays the number of requests where the status is “Resolved” or “Cancelled”
- **Avg Days to Close** – The average number of days from a request creation date to close date.
- **Solve rate** - # of Closed Requests divided by the total number of requests displayed as a percentage
