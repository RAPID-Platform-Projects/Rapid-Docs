## Digital Incident Report Form

**Incident Reports** can now be collected digitally, by sending users the URL to our **Digital Incident Report** form. User responses are then recorded in the Rapid database and can be acted upon by the WHS team. Rapid Standard comes packaged with the following Adaptive form prepared.

![A screenshot of the Incident Report form for Rapid. This form has the heading "Report Incident", and then the following fields for recording information: "Who is filling out this form?", "Date and Time", "Location", "Employees Impacted", "What anyone else impacted / involved?". Then there is a Description section with the fields: "What task was being performed at the time of the incident?" and "What happened?" Then there is a Factors section with the subheading: "use each of the lookups below to identify factors that may have contributed to the Incident." The fields after this are: "Environmental", "Equipment / Materials", "Work Systems" and "People". At the bottom of the form is a hCaptcha with a checkbox and the declaration "I am human." Finally, there is a submit button at the bottom of the form.](<Incident Form Collection.png>)

2. Select **Public Incident Form**

The first button is a folder in the sidebar titled "WHS" and has an icon of a heart with an ECG line through its centre. The link to the form reads "Public Incident Form" and has the alert symbol: a triangle with an exclamation mark in its centre. Both items that have been pressed have a white background with blue text (as opposed to the unpressed menu items, which have a blue background and white text).](<Incident Form Menu.png>)

In a new browser tab, the incident form will open.

:::note[URL]
You can copy the URL from your browser window if the form needs to be accessed elsewhere (e.g. sending the link via email). Note that this form will create an item in the Rapid database, and that the form contains the names of your employees.

## Incidents Table

Incidents entered into the digital **Incident Report** form are converted into database items, that can then be acted upon, edited, annotated, and have corrective actions applied. New incidents are added to the **Incidents** table in Rapid Standard.

### Accessing the Incidents Table

To access the **Incidents** table:

1. Press **WHS** in the [Sidebar](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/glossary/glossary.md#sidebar>)

2. Select **Incidents**

![A screenshot of the menu buttons that must be pressed in order to access the "Incidents" table. The first button is a folder in the sidebar titled "WHS" and has an icon of a heart with an ECG line through its centre. The link to the form reads "Incidents" and has the alert symbol: a triangle with an exclamation mark in its centre. Both items that have been pressed have a white background with blue text (as opposed to the unpressed menu items, which have a blue background and white text).](<Incident Table Menu.png>)

### Viewing Incidents

By default, the **Incidents** table contains the following columns for displaying incident items:
- *Incident Code* (the title field)
- *Date and Time*
- *Location*
- *Who is filling out this form?*
- *Status*
- *Employees Impacted*

![A screenshot of the "Incidents" table. The purpose of this image is to communicate to the reader the appearance of the table. The table is a standard Data Table, and contains the column headings listed above. There is some example data in the table, one item reads for example... Incident Code: "Incident - 000000334", Date and Time: "05/04/2024", Location: "Brisbane", Who is filling out this form?: "Joel Data", Status: "New", Employees Impacted: "Tom King, Jordan King".](<Incident Table.png>)

You can access, view, or edit individual incident items by [opening them from the **Incidents** table](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/1-Tables/1-viewing-data-using-tables/1-viewing-data-using-tables.md#item-icons>). When an **Incident Report** is opened, the page is structured as illustrated below:

![A screenshot of an example incident item in a Rapid site. The title of the incident is "INCIDENT - 000000034" and its layout is a standard Rapid item. The item has a pipeline that progressed from "New" to "Open", and finally "Closed". There are three main sections of the item: "General Details", "Description", and "Factors". These sections all contain information collected from the digital incident form (described above). At the bottom of the form is the "Corrective Action" data table, where a user can record items of corrective action that will be linked to the incident. The "Corrective Actions" table has the following headings: "Corrective Action Code", "Solution", "Who", "Incident Factors", and "Status".](<Incident Form Digital.png>)

There are four main sections of an **Incident Report** details page:

| Section | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Incident Pipeline** | |
| **General Details** | For recording crucial data such as who the incident affected, where it happened, and when it happened. |
| **Description** | For recording what happened and what task was being performed when the incident occurred. |
| **Factors** | For recording the *Environmental Factors*, *Equipment/Materials*, *Work systems*, or *People* that caused the incident. |
| **Corrective Actions** | This is another Data table where the **Corrective Actions** implemented by the **WHS** team can be recorded. |
