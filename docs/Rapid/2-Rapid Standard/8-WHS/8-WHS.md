# WHS Module

The WHS module allows you to document incidents and track corrective actions. Tasks can be automatically generated for the WHS Team as well. Employee License Management, Safety Audits, and Safety Checklists are included as well.

### Collect Incident Reports

Incident reports can be collected by sending users the URL to our **Digital Incident Report** form. Responses are then recorded in the Rapid database and can be acted upon by the WHS team.

This form has the heading "Report Incident", and then the following fields for recording information: "Who is filling out this form?", "Date and Time", "Location", "Employees Impacted", "What anyone else impacted / involved?". Then there is a Description section with the fields: "What task was being performed at the time of the incident?" and "What happened?" Then there is a Factors section with the subheading: "use each of the lookups below to identify factors that may have contributed to the Incident." The fields after this are: "Environmental", "Equipment / Materials", "Work Systems" and "People". At the bottom of the form is a hCaptcha with a checkbox and the declaration "I am human." Finally, there is a submit button at the bottom of the form.](<Incident Form Collection.png>)

### Digitally Document Incidents

Data entered into digital incident forms are converted into database items, that can then be acted upon, edited, annotated, and have corrective actions applied.

The item has a pipeline that progressed from "New" to "Open", and finally "Closed". There are three main sections of the item: "General Details", "Description", and "Factors". These sections all contain information collected from the digital incident form (described above). At the bottom of the form is the "Corrective Action" data table, where a user can record items of corrective action that will be linked to the incident. The "Corrective Actions" table has the following headings: "Corrective Action Code", "Solution", "Who", "Incident Factors", and "Status".](<Incident Form Digital.png>)
