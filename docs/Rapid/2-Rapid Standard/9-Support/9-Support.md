# Support Module

The **Support** module allows your organisation to take requests from clients, customers, or employees. The support module provides:
1. A form for users to submit requests.
2. The data structures for easily editing and managing requests.
3. An automated process that will assign tasks to the people deemed responsible for requests.

All this is achieved while keeping the original requester informed about the status of their request, with confirmation and update emails.
