# Related Items

Items on their own are useful, but when you start collecting them together into sets is where Rapid really sings.

Related items are one or more item associated with each other via a lookup or universal link. The relationship can be directional using a lookup, for example a Person (contact) works for a Company (contact). The relationship can also be bi-directional (aka: loose), like how a notes created on a task are universally linked together.

When working with items in Explorer, page components that display sets of items (data tables, boards and gantt charts) can be viewed in the context of some item. This will present **related items**, rather than everything in your site.

Similarly, tabs that show pages that also display sets of items behave in the same manner. The most classic version of this is the Tasks tab that comes default on most items.
