# Linked Items

The **Linked Items** page component will dynamically present all items that are linked to the current item. You can link items together using a **Workflow Process**, or manually via the [Linked Items Menu Button](</docs/Rapid/2-User Manual/2-Explorer/2-Items/6-items-linked/6-items-linked.md>).

The **Linked Items** component will display each table as an accordion menu, which can be expanded to display items.

![A screenshot of the "Linked Items" page component. The page component has the following accordion menus: "Assets (2)", "Industries (1)" and "Papers (1)". The user has clicked on the "Assets(2)" container, which has "opened" to reveal two items underneath its header. The two items read: "Three phase Pencil Making Machine, 125Kw" and "Best Paper Plate Making Machine". Each of the items has a "Go to item" button which has an icon of a slidebar and an arrow inside it pointing to the right. Each item also has a "Delete linked item" button, which has an icon of a cross or x.](<Linked Items Component Example.png>)

> In this example, there are two **Asset** items linked, so the accordion menu displays the text `Assets (2)` to indicate this.

If there are no linked items to display, the component will display the following message:

## Linked Item Default Component

Linked Items can be **viewed**, **added**, or **removed** to an item using the [Linked Items Menu Button](</docs/Rapid/2-User Manual/2-Explorer/2-Items/6-items-linked/6-items-linked.md>), which is a default component in the [Command Bar](</docs/Rapid/2-User Manual/glossary/glossary.md#command-bar>) for all Rapid items.
