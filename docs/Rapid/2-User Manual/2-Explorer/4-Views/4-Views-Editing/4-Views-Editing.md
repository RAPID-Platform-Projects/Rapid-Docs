# Editing A View's Appearance

There are two methods of editing a view. We are able to edit its appearance on the page (by affecting **column order**, **column width**, and **column sort order**). If we press the **Edit View Mode Button** (which has an icon of a pencil), we will enter the **Edit View Mode**.

When you are in this **Edit View Mode**, the column headers of the **Data Table** will be outlined in yellow. Additionally, a label above the column headers will state `Editing <View Name> View`.

In this mode, there are three main actions you can perform.

### Reordering Columns

You are able to reorder columns while in the **Edit View Mode**.

1. Click the name of a column in the header
2. Drag the column until your cursor is positioned between two other columns

The cursor is positioned, ready to release the "Email Address" column header between the "Name" and "Date of Birth" column headers.](<Views Edit Change Column Order.png>)

3. Note that a location icon will appear between the two columns to indicate where the column will be moved to
4. Release the cursor

### Changing Column Width

You can also change the width of a column.

1. Click on the line between the column headers.
2. Note the cursor changes to a "resizing" cursor
3. Click and drag to change the size of the column

### Changing Column Sort Order

You can also change the sorting order of the items in the table, by clicking on a column header. This will cause the header to become the "sorting" column. Clicking on the column again will change the column's sorting order from *Ascending* to *Descending*, and vice versa.

![A screenshot that demonstrates how an arrow appears to show whether a column is the ascending or descending sort column. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to highlight the sorting arrow.](<Views Edit Sort.png>)

When a column is the sorting column, an arrow will appear to indicate that it is either set to *sorting ascending*, or *sorting descending*. Note that any changes to the items order or sorting will not take effect until after you leave the **Editing View Mode**. This is explained in the next section.

## Leaving Edit View Mode

To leave the editing mode, return to the **Edit View Mode Button**. Note that now the button has changed to a checkmark. Pressing the checkmark will commit the changes, and return you to the regular **Explorer** experience.
