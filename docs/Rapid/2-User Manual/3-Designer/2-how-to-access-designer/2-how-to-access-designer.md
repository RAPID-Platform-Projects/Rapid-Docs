# How to access Designer

**Welcome to Designer -** This application allows you to create your business [database tables](</docs/Rapid/2-User Manual/glossary/glossary.md#data-table> "Data Table") and organise your Rapid Platform site according to your business needs.

In this guide, we will take a quick look at some of the important functions that you can perform using Designer in Rapid Platform.

:::info[Caution]
The **Designer** application is not suitable for users who do not have permission to edit, create, or delete the data structure of their organisation's Rapid site. **Designer** is an application that will usually be used by key persons (Keypers) who are responsible for building the functionality of a Rapid site.

**To access *Designer*:**

- Click on the Designer icon in the bottom left of the screen

As the Designer Window opens up, it will be by default on the tables page.

This is what the **Designer** screen looks like. The blue coloured left column is called the Designer [Sidebar](</docs/Rapid/2-User Manual/glossary/glossary.md#sidebar> "Sidebar"). The white portion lists the existing database tables.

For a newly created site, there would be no list of tables.

Please note the Designer Sidebar has collapsed design options titled - Tables, Features, Menus, Pages, Advanced.

These represent the key functions of Designer and houses all the design options in your site.
