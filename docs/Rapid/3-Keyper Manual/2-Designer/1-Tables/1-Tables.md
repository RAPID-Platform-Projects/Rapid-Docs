# Tables

The purpose of Rapid Platform is to allow users to create lists and have them displayed in whatever way they desire. To achieve this, tables are used. One *table* correlates to a list of *items*. A table is a great way of grouping information. For example, a table could contain the contact information of employees, price list information for finances or any other data you require.

Each Table contains multiple columns (or fields) that store data of a particular type (text, date, currency, etc). Each row on the table (called an item) represents some instance of those columns.

Rapid provides a baseline set of Tables as well as the ability to create and edit custom tables that can represent your own business data.

Tables are managed in Designer and power all of the Rapid Experiences.
