# Disabling the Command Bar

Occasionally, it is necessary to remove some features and functionality from a Table. For instance, you may wish to prevent someone from deleting an employee from the database. Even if an employee leaves the company, deleting them from your Rapid site can cause further problems.

For instance:
- Any **Lookups**, **Multi-Lookups** or **Linked Items** components will now point to nothing. This will make it difficult to keep track of what projects or responsibilities were assigned to the employee.
- If payroll wishes to contact a previous employee, this will no longer be possible if their item containing their contact details has been deleted.

To mitigate these problems, it is useful to prevent item deletion on important tables, and instead include a *Status* choice column, where a user can switch an item from *Active* to *Inactive*. You can then ensure that a table's main view only shows *Active* items. This "hides" items from view, rather than "deleting" them.

Below is an outline of the different functionality that can be disabled from a **Data Table**, and why each of these choices might be useful.

## Navigating to the Data Table Configuration Panel

1. Open your desired **Table** in [Designer](</docs/Rapid/2-User Manual/3-Designer/1-what-is-designer/1-what-is-designer.md>). This can be achieved by:
    - Opening the Table in **Explorer**, and then pressing the **Designer** button in the [Jumbotron](</docs/Rapid/2-User Manual/2-Explorer/0-navigating-explorer/0-navigating-explorer.md#jumbotron>)
    - Opening **Designer** via the **Sidebar** button, opening the table via the **Tables List**, and then clicking the **Design** tab. Ensure that the drop-down choice field beside the **Save** button is a plural (i.e. it should say "Employees" not "Employee").

For example, the table dropdown should state "Employees" instead of "Employee" (i.e. it must be plural to show the table view and not the item view. The Data Table component is also highlighted by a red box at the bottom of the screenshot.)](<Data Table Customisation Designer.png>)

2. You should now be able to see the **Data Table** as a page component.
3. Hover your cursor over the **Data Table** page component, so the **Data Table** overlay appears.

4. Click on the **Edit** button (it has an icon of a pencil).

5. This will open a side panel, where the **Data Table**'s [Command Bar](</docs/Rapid/2-User Manual/glossary/glossary.md#command-bar>) can have certain features disabled.

![A screenshot demonstrating what the side panel looks like. For example, this sidepanel has the title "Edit", and several fields including "Part of Module", "Table", "Default View", and several checkboxes which will be discussed in more detail in the next section.](<Data Table Side Panel Raw.png>)

Here, you can see the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| *Part of Module* | This field allows the you to disable the data table for users who do not have access to certain modules. |
| *Table* | This is the Rapid database table that the component will display. |
| *Default View* | Here you can set a view that the table will use as its default. |
| *Disable Creating Items Button* | This will hide **Create** button on the table, so that no new items can be created. |
| *Disable Edit View* | This disables users from being able to make edits to the current view. |
| *Disable Action Buttons* | This hides and disables any menu items that might trigger workflows, trigger webhooks, etc.|
| *Disable View Select* | This prevents users from changing the view to an alternative view. |

Note that any changes to the functionality of a **Data Table**'s **Command Bar** will only affect that particular instance of the **Command Bar**. For example, if there was another Data Table that pointed to the Employees Table, it would also need to have its **Command Bar** adjusted in the same way.

By default, all of the above functionality is enabled.

### Data Table Appearance

When all of the features present are disabled, the user will only see the following:
- The *Export to CSV* Button
- The *Inline Refresh* Button
- The *Quick Search Filter*
- The *List of Items*

![A screenshot that depicts the list above. All of the Command Bar has been disabled. New items cannot be created, nor can the view be changed or edited.](<Data Table All Disabled.png>)

## Disabling Delete

1. Open the Table in **Designer**.
2. Open the **Options** tab for the Table.
3. Click the checkbox that reads "Disable Delete Buttons"

![A screenshot demonstrating the location of the "Disable Delete Buttons". The screenshot shows Designer > Tables > Employees, and the standard Options tab. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to highlight the location of the button.](<Data Table Disable Delete.png>)

Unlike the options mentioned above, disabling the **Delete** button in the Command Bar will disable it across all instances of the **Data Table**. It will also disable the delete button so that it cannot be access from the page of any item that belongs to the table.

![A screenshot that demonstrates how this checkbox option will cause the delete button to be disabled. The delete button on the Employee page is no longer red, but is instead greyed out. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to highlight the location of the disabled delete button.](<Data Table Delete Item Page Disabled.png>)

> The **Delete** button is now greyed out, and cannot be used.
