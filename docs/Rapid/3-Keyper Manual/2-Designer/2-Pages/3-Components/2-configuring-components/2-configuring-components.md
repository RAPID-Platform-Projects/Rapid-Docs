# How to configure / update component properties

## Properties of a component

Each component allows you to configure a set of properties. These properties define the behaviour of the component in Explorer.

For example :

A Counter component will allow you to define which table you wish to select and the Table View.

## How to access the "Configure" Properties panel

Every component has an options panel, usually found at the top center of the componant (for some componants the options can be found at the top oir bottom right). Look for the pencil icon. As you click on this icon, the Configuration panel will open for the component on the right side.
