# Activity Feed

## What is the Activity Feed

An activity feed can be thought of as a bulletin board or activity log for the item. It helps you see the history for that item.

The activity feed component shows a timeline of added notes and previous events, such as when it was created or the prior updates.

## How to set up an Activity Feed Component in Designer

- You can [add the activity feed component on to the Layout / Page](/docs/Rapid/3-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-add-a-component/how-to-add-a-component.md "How to add a component to a Layout / Page?"). The Activity feed component is [present on the Tab Strip by default](/docs/Rapid/3-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-configure-item-details-and-item-creation/how-to-configure-item-details-and-item-creation.md "How to configure Item Details and Item Creation?").

- If the activity feed component is on a Grid Layout, you can [resize and move the component over the layout](/docs/Rapid/3-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-arrange-a-component-on-a-grid/how-to-arrange-a-component-on-a-grid.md "How to arrange a component on Grid layout?").
- You can set the [visibility of the activity feed on the Details screens](/docs/Rapid/3-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints.md "How to set a component to be visible / hidden on 'Item Details' and 'Create' breakpoints?")
