# Label

## Label component overview

Imagine you have four components stacked on a Grid Layout or there have been a bunch of fields in the Form component. You want to give more context to the information.

This is where the Label component is useful. A Label component is like a text tag that can be placed to organise a bunch of information on the page and provide more context for interpretation.

## How to set up Label component on a Layout / Page

- You can [add the Label component on to the Layout / Page](/docs/Rapid/3-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-add-a-component/how-to-add-a-component.md "How to add a component to a Layout / Page?"). The Label component is not present anywhere by default.

- If the Label component is on a Grid Layout, you can [resize and move the component over the layout](/docs/Rapid/3-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-arrange-a-component-on-a-grid/how-to-arrange-a-component-on-a-grid.md "How to arrange a component on Grid layout?").
- You can set the [visibility of Label on the Details breakpoint](/docs/Rapid/3-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints.md "How to set a component to be visible / hidden on 'Item Details' and 'Create' breakpoints?").

- You can set the [visibility of Label on the Create Screen breakpoint](/docs/Rapid/3-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints.md "How to set a component to be visible / hidden on 'Item Details' and 'Create' breakpoints?").

## How to set up Label component on a Form

- Just like adding Label component to the Layout, you can add it within the [Form component](/docs/Rapid/3-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/3-Components/form/form.md "What is a Form Component on a Layout / Page?") as well.

Please refer to the below video for illustration:

- Similar to Label on Grid Layout, you can [move and resize](/docs/Rapid/3-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-arrange-a-component-on-a-grid/how-to-arrange-a-component-on-a-grid.md), set visibility over [Details breakpoint](/docs/Rapid/3-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints.md) and [Create Screen breakpoint](/docs/Rapid/3-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints.md).

**Please note:**

- The Label component is ideally used for putting up label text for a few words. You cannot press Enter and put multiple lines of text in the Label. However, you can write text in a single line.
- There no Edit (pencil) icon to configure the Label component, as this component doesn't have any settings to define behaviour of the component.
