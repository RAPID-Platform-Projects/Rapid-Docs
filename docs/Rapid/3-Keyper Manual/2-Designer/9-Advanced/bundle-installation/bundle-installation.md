# Bundle Installation

It is possible to collect one or more custom entities into a package that can be installed onto a site. We call these packages a bundle. Adding a bundle is a quick way to set up a site with lists and pages.

Bundles can be installed from two locations, the public library or custom bundle files.

Note : For more information on custom bundle creation and their structure, see [Bundles](/docs/Rapid/3-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/9-Advanced/bundles/bundles.md "Bundles")
