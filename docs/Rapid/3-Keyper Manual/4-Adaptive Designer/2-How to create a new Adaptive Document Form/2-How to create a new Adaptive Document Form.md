You need to consider the following:

4. **Title** is the name of the Adaptive Form. This is a text field, so you can enter any title that logically depicts your form's purpose.

5. **Type** should be set to form in this dropdown field.

6. **Classification** - This is a dropdown field with options: 

    - *Draft* indicates that the form is being developed
    - *Published* indicates that the form is currently used in the site
    - *Archived* indicates the form is no loner needed or used

    You may select the one that best suits your classification of form; however, *Draft* is the most used classification. By default these classifications are only used for grouping forms, they have no structural effect unless you have built systems to use them (views, workflow automation etc).

7. **Description** describes the objective of the form here. It would help for future references.

8. After entering all the data, click on **Confirm**

The Adaptive Form Canvas will open. Your title will now appear on the top left area of the form canvas.
