# Item History

When viewing an item's details page, the **Item History** button allows you to view past versions of an item. Clicking on the button will reveal a list of all historical versions of the item: *who changed the item*, and *how long ago the change was made*.

### Item History User Interface

Each time an item is changed, the history list will expand. A key feature of the item's history is that you are able to select a previous state of the item, and revert back to a previous historical version of an item. To achieve this, simply click on an entry in the item history.

Clicking on a historical version from this list will change the contents of the item to display what data was entered and saved for that version. However, the item will revert back to its latest version unless the changes are saved.

### Viewing a previous version of an item

A new drop-down menu appears that displays the current historical version of an item that is being viewed. Additionally, a new warning label appears to explain that you are viewing a historical item.

### Reverting an item back to its current version

Pressing the **Undo Changes** button whilst viewing a historical view will revert the contents of the item back to its current state. Please note that an item's history does not track changes to the *Universal links* linked to an item.
