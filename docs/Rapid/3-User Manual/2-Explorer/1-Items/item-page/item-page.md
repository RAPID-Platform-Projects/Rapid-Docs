# Item Page

The item page is about a specific item from a table within your site. This page can enable viewing and changing:

1. Item Permissions

This is the Item's permissions configuration. It lists the users and groups which have access to the item. These are displayed as a user coin. To open more details as to what users exactly you are able to click on the 'Edit Permissions' button this will bring up the Permissions management config for that particular item. More can be read [here](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/explorer/page/item-level-permissions "Item-Level Permissions").

1. Basic Save Button The save button commits any changes made to an item to the database. Actions that can dirty data which will enable the save button include; Editing fields, adding a universal link and adding files.
2. Save and Close Button Performs the same action as a save button except closes the flyout as well. This is particularly useful if the save is the final edit to an item or if you wish to edit another item from the same list.
3. Deleting an Item This deletes the opened item. This is a basic delete which sets the item to a deleted state in the database. Deleted items' will not show up in Rapid Explorer. Deleting an item will close its flyout.

    :::info[**Note:**]
    Deleting an item will only remove it from the Rapid Site. The entry will still exist in the database meaning the action can be reverted by your system administrator.
