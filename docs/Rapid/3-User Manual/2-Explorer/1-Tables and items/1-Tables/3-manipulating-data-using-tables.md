# Manipulating Data Using Tables
## Selecting Multiple Items
Rapid Platform allows you to select multiple items at once. This allows you to use a button from the Command Bar, and apply its commands to multiple items. When multiple items are selected, this allows the user to: 
1. Delete multiple items
2. Link multiple items to another item
3. Launch a <a href="https://rapiddocs.z8.web.core.windows.net/docs/Rapid/User%20Manual/Workflow/workflow-introduction">process or workflow</a> using multiple items

To select items in Rapid, hover the cursor over an item row. A circle will appear on the far left of the item row. Press this selection circle.

Once you select an item, you will see the circle will become filled, and now display a checkmark. Additionally, the background will be faintly highlighted in grey.

You can press additional selection circles to select multiple items.

## Downloading a CSV Version of the Current View
The Command Bar also contains an **Export as CSV** button, which will export and download the current table, including any views or filters, as a .csv file.

The button will download the CSV file to your computer, in your computer's default downloads folder.
