# File Management

When moving to Rapid, a common question is: "How do I store files on Rapid?"

Rapid offers several solutions for file management, which will allow you to not only store files, but to also connect those files to items in your Rapid site.

## File System

Rapid's file management system is built upon Microsoft's *Sharepoint*, which is a cloud-based file storage system. This means that your files can be uploaded to *Sharepoint* and do not need to be stored on a local hard drive.

You can access all of your files directly using Sharepoint, or you can choose to manipulate them using Rapid components. Below, we will discuss how to do both.

## File Browser Component

By default, all Rapid items include a **Files** tab. The **Files** tab directs us to a page that contains the [File Browser](</>) component. The **File Browser** automatically opens the necessary folder in *Sharepoint*, which holds the items associated with our item.

This means we can quickly access the files that have been stored against a particular item in our database.
