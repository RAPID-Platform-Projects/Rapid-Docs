# Files

When moving to Rapid, a common question is: "How do I store files on Rapid?"

Rapid offers several solutions for file management, which will allow you to not only store files, but to also connect those files to items in your Rapid site.

## Microsoft Sharepoint

Rapid's file management system is built upon Microsoft's *Sharepoint*, which is a cloud-based file storage system. This means that your files can be uploaded to *Sharepoint* and do not need to be stored on a local hard drive.

You can access all of your files directly using Sharepoint, or you can choose to manipulate them using Rapid components. Below, we will discuss how to do both.

## File Browser Component

By default, all Rapid [items](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/2-Items/1-items-overview/1-items-overview.md>) include a **Files** tab. The **Files** tab directs us to a page that contains the [File Browser](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/3-Pages/2-Page Components/File-Browser/File-Browser.md>) component. The **File Browser** automatically opens the necessary folder in *Sharepoint*, which holds the items associated with our item.

This means we can quickly access the files that have been stored against a particular item in our database.

:::For Example[note]
For an upcoming project, you are given a .PDF document that contains the signatures of key stakeholders who have signed off on the project. You can store a this .PDF document, or any other type of file, so that it appears in the "Files" tab of the Project item.
