# Items Overview

*Items* are containers where data is stored. An item can be anything, but what it represents is always determined by the Table it is stored on. For example:
- Each item stored on an *Employees* table, will represent an employee.
- Each item stored on a *Cars* table, will represent a car, etc.

## Items as Rows

Items are represented as a single row on a [Rapid Table](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/1-Tables/1-viewing-data-using-tables/1-viewing-data-using-tables.md>).

In the screenshot below, the Table named "tasks" stores a list of tasks for employees to complete. Note the single item that has been highlighted.

We can open items, read their data, add new data, edit existing data, or delete the entire item.

## Data Types as Columns

You system administrator will determine which columns should exist on a table. This also determines which types of data will be stored in that table's items.

In the screenshot above, the system administrator has created the following columns: *Title*, *Assigned To*, *Start Date*, *Due Date*, and *Status*. Note, however, that there are additional columns not shown here. Each item contains [default fields](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/1-Tables/4-default-fields/4-default-fields.md>) that are usually not visible. 

Additionally, to ensure items have a clean and simple appearance, your system administrator might choose to only show some columns when viewing them on a table.

If we open an item, we will be able to see the other columns that are not visible here.
