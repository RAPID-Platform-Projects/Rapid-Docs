# Viewing and Editing Items

There are several ways for us to open an item to view or edit it.

### Clicking the Icon

We can click on the item's **Icon**. This is a small image on the far left side of the item row. The icon will become underlined, and your mouse cursor will change to a hand to indicate that this is a hyperlink to another webpage.

## Fields and the Item Page

Note in the screenshot below that once we open an item, the item's data is no longer arranged as columns. This is called the **Item Page**, and it is the main method for users to edit data on an item.

You will notice that the Columns we created (*Name*, *DOB*, and *Email*) have changed appearance. These boxes, where data can be typed or entered, are called **Fields**. All columns created by your system administrator can appear as a **Field**.

This is also where any fields that may have been hidden from view in the table can be viewed and edited.
