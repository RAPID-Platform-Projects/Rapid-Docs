# Creating a New Item

When viewing a [Table](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/1-Tables/1-viewing-data-using-tables/1-viewing-data-using-tables.md>), click on the **+ New (Table Name)** button in the [Command Bar](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/glossary/glossary.md#command-bar>). The button will have an icon that matches the **Item** icons in the **Table**.

This will open the **Create Screen** panel, which will prompt you to enter data and to create the item. Your system administrator may disable some fields from being visible on the Create Screen.

The **+ Create** button will create the **Item** and return you to the **Table**. The **Create and Open** button will create the item, and open that item in your browser.

At the top of the panel are the words "New Employee", as this example takes place on the "Employees" table. Underneath the title are two buttons: "+ Create" and "Create and Open". Below this are several fields for the user to enter data. In this example, these fields are "Name", "Date of Birth", "Email Address" and then a grey field titled "Name and Email".](<Create Screen.png>)

> Note that some fields may also be visible, but displayed. This is indicated by fields that have a grey background. In this example, the "Name and Email" field is a [**Subquery**](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/2-Items/1-items-overview/1-items-overview.md#columns-and-fields>) field, so it cannot be edited by a user.
