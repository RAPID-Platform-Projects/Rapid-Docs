# Creating a New Item

When viewing a [Table](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/1-Tables/1-viewing-data-using-tables/1-viewing-data-using-tables.md>), click on the **+ New (Table Name)** button in the [Command Bar](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/glossary/glossary.md#command-bar>). The button will have an icon that matches the **Item** icons in the **Table**.

This will open the **Create Screen** panel, which will prompt you to enter data and to create the item. Your system administrator may disable some fields from being visible on the Create Screen.

The **+ Create** button will create the **Item** and return you to the **Table**. The **Create and Open** button will create the item, and open that item in your browser.

At the top of the panel are the words "New Employee", as this example takes place on the "Employees" table. Underneath the title are two buttons: "+ Create" and "Create and Open". Below this are several fields for the user to enter data. In this example, these fields are "Name", "Date of Birth", "Email Address" and then a grey field titled "Name and Email".](<Create Screen.png>)

> Note that some fields may also be visible, but displayed. This is indicated by fields that have a grey background. In this example, the "Name and Email" field is a [**Subquery**](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/2-Items/1-items-overview/1-items-overview.md#columns-and-fields>) field, so it cannot be edited by a user.

## Creating a New Sub-type of Items

If you are viewing a table that has subtypes, your system administrator may have created additional buttons to create items. For example, in the Rapid Standard Assets Module, there are several "New X Asset"
 buttons that will each create a different subtype of item on the same table. To learn more about this, visit the following link:

## Cloning an Item

It is also possible to "clone" an item. When an item is cloned, Rapid will open the **Create Screen**, and copy across the data from the current item, to the new item. This enables you to quickly build similar items without having to enter data multiple times.

For example, if your company owned two vehicles that were the same Make, Model, and Year, you could use the clone tool to copy this information and reduce the time spent entering data.

To clone an item:

1. Open an **Item** in [Explorer](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/0-navigating-explorer/0-navigating-explorer.md>)

2. Find the **Clone** button in the [Jumbotron](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/0-navigating-explorer/0-navigating-explorer.md#jumbotron>) at the top of the site. This button will only be visible when you are viewing an Item Page.

The button's icon resembles two blank pages stacked atop each other. To the right of the Clone button is the Designer Button, then the Launchpad Notifications Bell, the User Coin, and the Rapido Chatbot Button.](<Clone Item.png>)

3. The data from the original item has now been copied across to the fields in the **Create Screen Panel**.

4. Press the **Create** or **Create and Open** button to create the Item. Alternatively, you can press the **Undo Changes** if you do not wish to cancel.
