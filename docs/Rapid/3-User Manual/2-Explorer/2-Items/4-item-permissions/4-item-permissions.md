# Item-Level Permissions

Each item in Rapid Platform can have unique user permissions. This means on a per-item basis, you can select who is allowed to **Read**, **Write**, or **Delete** an item. Note that if you wish to [set default permissions for all items in a table](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/1-Tables/6-permissions/6-permissions.md>), this is also possible.
