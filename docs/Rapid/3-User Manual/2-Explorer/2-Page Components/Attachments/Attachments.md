# Attachments
Files may be attached to any item in Rapid, using the Attachments page component. For example, you may wish to:
- Upload a .PDF invoice to a project
- Attach a .DOCX purchase request to an asset
- Add an old .CSV spreadsheet to a quote
- Include an image file containing an employee's forklift license

Rapid enables you to upload external documentation, so it is available and accessible from within the system.

## Adding the Attachments Component
1. Navigate to where you would like to add the **Attachments** component. This is usually the **Details Page** of an item.

2. Open the **Designer** view, by clicking the icon of a ruler and set square in the upper right corner of the site.

3. Click the **+** symbol on the *Grid Layout* overlay, in the bottom-right corner of the page.

4. Select the **Attachments** component

5. Resize the component by clicking and dragging the bottom-right corner of the component (which has a darker corner).

In the Designer view of an item's details page, components can be resized by clicking and dragging on the bottom right corner of any component. This corner is a darker shade of grey to indicate it can be used for resizing.](<Attachments Resizing Component.png>)

6. You can reposition the component on the page, by clicking and dragging on the centre of the component.

*Please Note:* The **Attachments** component will dynamically increase in height, as more files are added. When designing the layout of your page, it is wise to place this component at the bottom of the page, or to the side of the page.

7. Press the **Save** button at the top of the page

## Using the Attachments Component
When viewing the **Attachments** component in **Explorer**, it will appear as a dotted grey box surrounding the word "Attachments".

There are two methods for uploading files using the **Attachments** component.
1. You can click the **Attachments** pane to open your file browser, and select the files you wish to upload.

2. You can also drag files from your device, onto the **Attachments** component.

### Observing files that are uploading
While a file is uploading, a loading icon and progress bar will appear in the component. Once the file has finished uploading, the file's *Title*, *Type*, and *Icon* will be displayed as an **Attachment Record**. The Attachments component also includes options for you to *Open*, *Download*, or *Remove* the file.

Next, we will now closely examine the **Attachment Record** that is created when attaching a file, and the functionality it provides.

#### Opening an Attachment Record

Pressing the **Open** button on an **Attachment Record** will open the file in Microsoft Online, if possible. For example, .DOC and .DOCX files will be opened in Word Online, whereas a .CSV file would open in Excel Online.

![A screenshot that displays how an Attachment Record has an "Open" button, where the attachment can be opened in Microsoft Online.](<Attachments Record Open.png>)

The file can then be edited and saved within Microsoft Online. This allows the user to update attachments and save them. The file will not need to be uploaded again, as the changes are made to the attached file directly.

#### Downloading an Attachment Record
Files can also be downloaded from an **Attachment Record**, using the **Download** button. The file will appear in your browser's download history, and in the downloads folder on your device.

![A screenshot that displays how an Attachment Record has a "Download" button, that allows the user to download the attachment directly to their PC.](<Attachments Record Download.png>)

#### Removing an Attachment Record
Lastly, an Attachment Record can be removed. The file attached to the item will also be deleted.

![A screenshot that displays how an Attachment Record has a "Remove" button, where the attached files will be deleted from the item.](<Attachments Record Remove.png>)

### Uploading additional files
Note that although the appearance of the **Attachments** folder has changed, you may still upload files as before.
1. Clicking on any part of the attachment that is not the *Open*, *Download* or *Remove* buttons, will open your file browser so that more files can be added.

2. Dragging and dropping a file on top of the component as before, will allow you to add additional files.

### Folders
All files uploaded via the **Attachments** component are placed inside an "Attachments" folder in your organisation's sharepoint. If an Attachments folder does not exist, the component will create this folder when the first file is uploaded.

Note that you can view any files or folders attached to an item by clicking the **Files** tab at the top of an item's page.

![A screenshot showing how to view the files and folders attached to an item. The user must navigate to the "Files" tab at the top of an item's page.](<Attachments Folders.png>)

You can open the "Attachments" folder, to view the attachment files inside. Additionally, the **Files** tab allows you to view the files inside your organisation's SharePoint, change the folder they are located in, or preview the file in the preview pane on the right.
