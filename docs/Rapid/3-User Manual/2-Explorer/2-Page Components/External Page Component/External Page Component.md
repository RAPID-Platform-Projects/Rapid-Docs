# **What is an External Page component?**

Imagine you are an Air Traffic Controller. You are looking at the schedule of the Incoming and Outgoing flights from the Airport. Along with the schedule, you have a Live Weather feed from an external website on your Page.

OR

There can be a static page like Wikipedia which provides the context / definition / information about your table data.

If you are viewing an data from an external webpage, it is possible via the External Page component in Rapid Platform.
