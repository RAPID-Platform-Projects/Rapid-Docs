## Gantt Chart in Full Screen

The Gantt Chart can be viewed in Full Screen mode. The Full Screen mode allows you to view the Gantt Chart over the maximum width of screen possible. This enables a better span of bars, leading to better assimilation of information. Also, particularly useful for taking screenshots / screen sharing etc.
