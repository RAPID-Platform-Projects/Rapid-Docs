# Introduction to Pages in Explorer

Pages is a fundamental concept in Rapid Platform. A Page in Explorer hosts components and displays information as configured in Designer. Whether it is a Gantt Chart, Counter component, Data Table, Board, or Report etc., every component needs a Page on which it can be hosted. Page enables adding, editing and viewing capabilities based on the nature of components hosted on it.​
​
Arguably, among the most important applications of Explorer, is data management through tables (item list) and individual items. An average system user will most likely interact with Explorer for referring to information in tables.​

Therefore, in this article, we discuss Pages for tables in Explorer.​

​With reference to Pages for tables, there can be two types:​

**List page** – This is the page which hosts the information about the item lists or group of items as configured in Designer.​
**Single item page** – This can be a group of pages which hosts different types of information with reference to a single item of the table, as configured in Designer. The collection of pages may include item details page, activity page, files page, tasks page and other custom created pages.
