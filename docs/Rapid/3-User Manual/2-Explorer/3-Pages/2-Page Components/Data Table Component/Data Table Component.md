# Data Table Component

The data table is arguably the most important page component, as it is used to *create*, *delete*, *edit*, *view*, and *sort* [Items](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/2-Items/1-items-overview/1-items-overview.md>). Whenever a Table is added to your Rapid site's database, the following happens automatically:

- A [Page](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/3-Pages/1-Pages Introduction/1-Pages Introduction.md>) is created for your Table
- A [Menu Item](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/8-Menus/8-Menus.md>) is created in the sidebar, which links to the Page
- The **Data Table** component is placed on that Page, and connected to the database Table

Therefore, the **Data Table** page component is crucial for viewing our items and data.

The **Data Table** can also be placed on *any* Page. For example, a **Data Table** can be placed inside an item's page to show connections between [Linked Items](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/2-Items/6-items-linked/6-items-linked.md>), for example.

- If you are unfamiliar with **Tables**, you should first read about how [Tables View and Manipulate Data](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/1-Tables/1-viewing-data-using-tables/1-viewing-data-using-tables.md>).

## Creating Items

Using the **Create** button in a **Data Table** component, you can create new items within a Table.

## Refreshing Data Tables

If the data within in a table is updated, the table will need to be refreshed in order for that data to be visible. Refreshing the entire page is not desirable as you may need to reauthenticate, which will take time.

Rapid Platform includes an *Inline Refresh* button, that allows you to refresh all the items in a data table component. The *Inline Refresh* is located in the [Command Bar](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/glossary/glossary.md#command-bar>), and has an icon that resembles a clockwise arrow.

## Data Tables Can Filter Items

There are several methods for filtering the items visible on a **Data Table**. Filtering Items allows us to quickly find the relevant data we need.

**Table Views** provide a means to control what items are shown in a list. You can consider **Table Views** as a filter on a **Data Table**, which organises and displays information based on defined criteria.

Views work in tandem with **Filters**. For example, a **Table** can have a [Quick Filter](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/1-Tables/1-viewing-data-using-tables/1-viewing-data-using-tables.md#quick-filtering-items>) enabled, as well as a View. This means that as a user, you can quickly find the item you are searching for.
