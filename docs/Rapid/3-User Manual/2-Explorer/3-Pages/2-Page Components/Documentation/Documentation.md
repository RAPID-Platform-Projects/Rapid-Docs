# Documentation

Sometimes you just need to write something down and show it on the page. When you need to simply present static text, look toward the Documentation Component.

For example, Stationery Inc have configured a leave form and noticed the same common questions being asked when people would fill it out. To help alleviate this they have added a small explainer to the page using the Documentation Component.
