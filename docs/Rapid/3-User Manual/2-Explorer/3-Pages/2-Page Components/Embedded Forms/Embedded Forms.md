# Embedded Forms

When an item is usually accessed from a Rapid table, you are only able to edit data associated with that item. However, **Embedded Forms** enable us to access, add, or edit data from other tables.

:::note[Example]
A user is sent a **Task** item requesting that data be entered into an item. An **Embedded Form** allows the user to submit the data without having to leave the current **Task** item.

This allows the user to quickly add the data and tick the *Complete* button.

The embedded form also has a faint blue-grey background. Its title reads "Corrective Actions Details", and has some fields such as: "Corrective Action Code":"#000032", "Completed":"Thu May 30 2024", "Incident":"INCIDENT - 00000034", "Solution":"Provide adequate lighting in the stairwell."](<Embedded Form Example.png>)
