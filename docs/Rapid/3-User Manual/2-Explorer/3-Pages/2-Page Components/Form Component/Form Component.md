# Form Component

The **Form Component** is used to store the fields of an item on the item page. We often use forms in the physical world. For example, we need to fill out a form when we visit a dentist for the first time. We need to complete a form to start studying at an educational institution, or to complete our tax returns at the end of the financial year.

These physical forms are simply [fields](</docs/todo>) of data, just like in Rapid. When you submit a form to your dentist, you are really submitting a collection of fields (e.g. *Name*, *Private Health Insurance*, *Date of Birth*, etc.)

While we have briefly discussed how the data in an item can be edited, in this section we will go into detail about this process.

## Appearance

**Forms** are invisible when we view them in [Explorer](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/0-navigating-explorer/0-navigating-explorer.md>). However, we *can* see a form when viewing an item's page in [Designer](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/3-Designer/1-what-is-designer/1-what-is-designer.md>).

To view a form:

1. Open an [Item](<docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/2-Items/1-items-overview/1-items-overview.md>) in [Explorer](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/0-navigating-explorer/0-navigating-explorer.md>).

2. Click the Designer button at the top of the site (in the [Jumbotron](/docs/Rapid/3-User%20Manual/2-Explorer/0-navigating-explorer/0-navigating-explorer.md#jumbotron)).

The screenshot is annotated with a red box and a red arrow, which highlight the location of the Designer button. The designer button is button that resembles a Ruler and a Set Square.](<Forms Designer Button.png>)

3. The item will now open in the [Designer](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/3-Designer/1-what-is-designer/1-what-is-designer.md>) application, where we can see how the item's page has been designed by the System Administrator. Here, we can see the form is box with a dashed border, where all of our fields are stored.

4. To return to Explorer, we go back to where the Designer button was. It how now changed to the Explorer button, which is stylised as a browser with a magnifying glass. Clicking on this button will return us to Explorer.

![A screenshot that shows how the user can return to Explorer. They must return to the jumbotron at the top of the site, and press the button that resembles a browser window with a magnifying glass. The button is beside the dark blue Rapido Chatbot button. The screenshot is annotated with a red box and red arrow to highlight where the button is located on the site.](<Forms Explorer Return.png>)

### Labels

Labels are large pieces of text that act as headings on an item page. Labels allow us to understand sections of complex form. The example below is from a Rapid Standard item called "Incidents". Both the "General Details" and "Descriptions".
