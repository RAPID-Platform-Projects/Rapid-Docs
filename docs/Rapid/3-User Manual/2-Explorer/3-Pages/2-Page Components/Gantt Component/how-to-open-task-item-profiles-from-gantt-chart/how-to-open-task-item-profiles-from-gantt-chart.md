# Opening Tasks

While Gantt Chart offers a great visual representation of all tasks associated to a data table with reference to time; there may be a need to view the details of a particular task.

Viewing details of individual tasks is easy from Gantt Chart interface in RAPID Platform.

## Viewing Task Details from the bar
