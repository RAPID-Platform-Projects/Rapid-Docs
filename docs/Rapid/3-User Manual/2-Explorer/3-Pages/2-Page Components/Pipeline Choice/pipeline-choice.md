# Pipeline Choice

The **Pipeline Choice** component allows a user to quickly and visually assess the status of an item. For example, a **Pipeline Choice** could be used to indicate the location of a client within a sales funnel, or the corrective stage of an incident report.

## Pipelines Inherit from a Choice Column

In order to use a **Pipeline Choice**, a *Choice Column* must first be present on the table.
- You can learn about [adding a column to a table](</docs/Rapid/4-Keyper Manual/2-Designer/1-Tables/5-Table Configuration Guides/how-to-add-columns-to-a-data-table/how-to-add-columns-to-a-data-table.md>)
- You can also learn about [adding a pipeline component to a page](</docs/Rapid/4-Keyper Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/3-Components/pipeline/pipeline.md>).

## Pipeline Synchronise with a Choice Field

Selecting a value in the **Pipeline** is identical to selecting the option from a **Choice**-type field. If you have the same field added as a **Choice** field, they will always be in sync with each other.

The colour of the **Pipeline** choices are derived from the **Choice** column. If colours are defined in the options of a **Choice** column, they will appear in the Pipeline.
