# Command Bar

The **File Browser's Command Bar** contains many useful functions for navigating and managing files in your Rapid site's *Sharepoint*.

If the screen width or browser window are too small, the **Command Bar** may hide certain menu items. To reveal the hidden menu items, select the ellipsis (`...`) icon in the **Command Bar**. The hidden menu items will appear in a drop-down menu.

The ellipsis button and the menu items dropdown menu have all been annotated with a red box to indicate their location. The menu items that appear in this example are: "Email Files", "Delete", "Upload Files" and "Create Task with Attachments".](<Files Ellipsis Dropdown.png>)

Each of these menu items and their functions are explained below.

## Create a New Folder

To keep files organised, you may wish to add additional folders to the current file directory. This way, new files that are uploaded can be added to these folders, just as though you were using your operating system's file browser.

To add a new folder:

1. Press the **+ New** button.

2. Select **Folder**.

3. A new folder item will appear inside the **File Browser** display area, alongside any other folders or items that may be saved in this directory.

4. Delete the **New Folder** text by pressing **Backspace ⌫** on your keyboard (Windows & Linux) or **Delete ⌫** (Mac).

5. Type the desired name for your folder instead.

6. Press **Enter ↵** or **Return ↵** on your keyboard.

3. The file will now upload.

The File's name is "Example Attachment.docx", followed by a download icon, which is a cloud with an arrow pointing downwards. In this example, the file states it was "Last Modified an hour ago". The "Modified By" column is blurred out to protect the privacy of the user. The file size is 0.0MB as it is an empty document.](<Files Upload Complete.png>)
