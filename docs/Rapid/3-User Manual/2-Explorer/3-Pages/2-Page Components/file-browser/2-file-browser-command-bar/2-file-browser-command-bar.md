# Command Bar

The **File Browser's Command Bar** contains many useful functions for navigating and managing files in your Rapid site's *Sharepoint*.

![A screenshot showing how an ellipsis will appear in the Command Strip instead of the expected menu buttons, if the screen width is too small. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to show the location of the ellipsis icon.](<Files Ellipsis.png>)

If the screen width or browser window are too small, the **Command Bar** may hide certain menu items. To reveal the hidden menu items, select the ellipsis (`...`) icon in the **Command Bar**. The hidden menu items will appear in a drop-down menu.

![A screenshot showing the menu items that appear when clicking on the ellipsis. The ellipsis button and the menu items dropdown menu have all been annotated with a red box to indicate their location. The menu items that appear in this example are: "Email Files", "Delete", "Upload Files" and "Create Task with Attachments".](<Files Ellipsis Dropdown.png>)

Each of these menu items and their functions are explained below.

## Create a New Folder

To keep files organised, you may wish to add additional folders to the current file directory. This way, new files that are uploaded can be added to these folders, just as though you were using your operating system's file browser.

To add a new folder:

1. Press the **+ New** button.

![A screenshot that demonstrates the appearance of the "+ New" menu button. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to highlight the button's location in the Command Bar.](<Files New Button.png>)

2. Select **Folder**.

![A screenshot that demonstrates the appearance of the Folder menu item that appears in the "+ New" dropdown menu. Currently, it is the only item that appears. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to highlight the location of the menu item.](<Files New Dropdown.png>)

3. A new folder item will appear inside the **File Browser** display area, alongside any other folders or items that may be saved in this directory.

![A screenshot that demonstrates what the field for typing a new folder name looks like. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to highlight the location of the field. The field has an icon of a folder, followed by the default text "New Folder".](<Files New Folder.png>)

4. Delete the **New Folder** text by pressing **Backspace ⌫** on your keyboard (Windows & Linux) or **Delete ⌫** (Mac).

5. Type the desired name for your folder instead.

6. Press **Enter ↵** or **Return ↵** on your keyboard. Alternatively, you can click elsewhere on the page, and the text field where you were typing will disappear. The folder name you typed into the field will be saved automatically.

:::info[Illegal File Names]
When creating a folder, *Sharepoint* will prevent you from using an "illegal" name. For example, certain symbols and characters are not allowed in a folder name. If a folder contains a `/` for example, the **File Browser** will issue a warning in red, and will not allow the folder to be created.

![A screenshot demonstrating the message that appears when an illegal folder name is typed into the naming field. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to show the illegal character that has been used (a "/" ). The message reads: "You can't call a file or folder by the name of "New Folder/Example". Please choose another name.](<Files Illegal Folder.png>)

## Upload Files via the Command Bar

1. Click the **Upload files** button in the **Command Bar**.

![A screenshot demonstrating the location of the "Upload files" button in the command bar. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to highlight the button's location.](<Files Upload.png>)

:::note[Upload Files]
When an item is selected, this button will be "pushed" to a position further along the Command Bar.
:::

2. Select the intended file to upload and click **Open** in the pop-out window from your operating system's file browser.

![A screenshot demonstrating how to select a file from the operating system and then click "open" on the pop-out window. The screenshot is annotated in red. A red box surrounds the item that should be selected, then a red arrow directs the user that they must click the "Open" button afterwards.](<Files Upload OS.png>)

3. The file will now upload.

![A screenshot of the file now uploaded. The screenshot is annotated in red to show how the file will appear in a list within the component. The File's name is "Example Attachment.docx", followed by a download icon, which is a cloud with an arrow pointing downwards. In this example, the file states it was "Last Modified an hour ago". The "Modified By" column is blurred out to protect the privacy of the user. The file size is 0.0MB as it is an empty document.](<Files Upload Complete.png>)

## Renaming Files and Folders

You may need to rename a file, folder, or multiple files and folders in your *Sharepoint*. The **File Browser** allows you to do this without leaving your Rapid site.

1. Select the file(s) or folder(s) you wish to rename

2. Press the **Rename** button that appears in the **Command Bar**

![A screenshot of the Command Bar that shows the "Rename Button". The screenshot is annotated with a red box to indicate the button's location. The Rename button has an icon of a field being edited by an "editing" cursor.](<Files Rename Menu.png>)

3. Any files or folders selected will now have a field appear in their name column. Microsoft files will have a field name, followed by a filetype tag, indicating the type of document it is.

4. Click on the field that you wish to edit. This field will behave the same as typing into a **Single Line Text** field in any Rapid form.

![A screenshot demonstrating what the text field looks like when renaming a file. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to highlight the location of the text field.](<Files Rename Item.png>)

4. Delete the old file or folder name by pressing **Backspace ⌫** on your keyboard (Windows & Linux) or **Delete ⌫** (Mac).

5. Type the desired name for your folder instead.

6. Press **Enter ↵** or **Return ↵** on your keyboard. Alternatively, you can click elsewhere on the page, and the text fields where you were typing will disappear. The file names you typed into the fields will be saved automatically.

:::info[Illegal File Names]
When naming a file or folder, *Sharepoint* will prevent you from using an "illegal" name. For example, certain symbols and characters are not allowed in a file name. If a file or folder contains a `/` for example, the **File Browser** will issue a warning in red, and will not allow the file or folder to be renamed.

![A screenshot demonstrating the message that appears when an illegal file name is typed into the naming field. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to show the illegal character that has been used (a "/" ). The message reads: "You can't call a file or folder by the name of "Example Attachment/Example". Please choose another name.](<Files Illegal Name.png>)

## Emailing Files

The **Files Browser** allows you to send files via email, and to also compose the email before sending it.

1. Select the file(s) that you wish to E-mail

:::info[Folders Cannot Be Emailed]
Selecting a folder in the **File Browser** and then pressing the **E-mail Files** button, will merely cause an empty email to be generated. This occurs whether the folder contains other files, or if it is empty.
:::

2. Click **E-mail Files** button in the Command Bar

![A screenshot demonstrating the "E-mail Files" button and how it appears in the Command Bar. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to highlight the location of the button. The button has an icon of an envelope.](<Files Email.png>)

3. The Microsoft 365 email app will open, allowing you to send an email with the file(s) attached.

4. Press the **Edit Email** button to edit the *draft* email that has been generated. It has an icon of a pencil.

![A screenshot showing how to edit the draft email that is generated. The screenshot is annotated by a red arrow that points to a red box. Inside the red box is the Edit Email button. These annotations are to highlight the location of the button.](<Files Email Pre-Popout.png>)

5. You can now compose your email, choose it recipient, and then send it.

## Creating A Task with Attachments

Sometimes you may wish to create a new [Task](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/8-Tasks/8-Tasks.md>) that connected to a file in your *Sharepoint* directory. The **File Browser** includes a button so that once a file or files are selected, a task can be generated with the selected file(s) attached to it.

1. Select the file(s) you wish to link to a new **Task**

2. In the **Command Bar**, press the **Create Task with attachments** button

![A screenshot that shows the location of the "Create Task with attachments" button. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to show the button's location in the Command Bar. The button also has an icon of a paper clip.](<Files Create Task.png>)

3. The "New Task" **Create Screen** will open on the right side of the site

![Alt text](<Files New Task.png>)

4. Fill out the **Task** information and details as desired

5. Press **+ Create** at the top of the **Create Screen**

6. The task will now be generated, and the selected files will appear as *Attachments* in the **Files** tab of the Task item, or in the **Attachments** component of the item.

:::notes[Task Files]
If the files do not appear on a **Task**, this might be because your System Administrator has not added a page component to the *Tasks* page for viewing files.
:::

![Alt text](<Files Task Parent.png>)

:::info[Task Parent]
Creating a **Task** this way will cause Rapid to fill the *Parent* field with a lookup link to the current item where the files are located. In this example, the files that are being used to generate a task are located inside an project item titled "Office Building Construction". Once the new Task is created, it will also link back to this item.

## Opening Files

### Downloading Files

Files can be opened by [downloading the files](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/3-Pages/2-Page Components/File-Browser/1-File-Browser/1-File-Browser.md#files-as-items>) and then opening them with your operating system or browser. This can be achieved using the in-line download button on a file that appears in the **Files Browser** component.

![A screenshot that demonstrates the location of the in-line download button. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to highlight the button's location. The button's icon resembles a cloud with an arrow descending from it.](<Files Item Download.png>)
