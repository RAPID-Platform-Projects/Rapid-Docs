# Changing Views

Alternative views can be selected using the **Views Dropdown** menu button. The default "All" view is available for selection. The "All" view displays all items present in the **Data Table**. It's important to note here that the "All" view option can be enabled or disabled (in **Designer**) by user according to their needs.

To change views:

1. Press the **Views Dropdown** menu button.
2. Select a **View** from the dropdown menu.
3. The dropdown menu button's label will change to display the name of the view that is currently in use.

The "All" view has a tick next to it to indicate it is the currently selected view. Additionally, the muse cursor is hovering over this view, so the background of the dropdown button is grey.](<Views Dropdown All.png>)

> In the example above, the "All" view has been selected, because its name appears next to the filter icon. Additionally, the view that is currently selected will have a checkmark icon beside the view name in the dropdown list.
