## Easier segmentation for Reminders and Mentions

The new notifications interface makes it easier to pickup the mentions and reminders from the remaining list. 

Earlier, there was one list of all notifications and one had to search for reminders / mentions. This was a peculiar problem when the list of notifications was long.

:::tip[Please note]  
Observe that the number of unread mentions and reminders is also visible.  

"All" will display the full list of notifications arranged in descending order of date and time. This is the default tab selected when you access notification interface. (shown above)

"Mentions" will show all unread mentions in descending order of date and time. Notice the icon of "@" comes against mentions.

"Reminders" will display the list of unread reminders in descending order of date and time. Observe the icon of reminder against it.

## Header and body visible in the notification list

The new notification interface will show both the header and the body (without truncating it) in the notification list itself. This brings ease of viewing the notification and reduces the time to assimilate the message.

Earlier, only the header used to appear in the notification list and the user had to open the notification to read the body.

## Action buttons for notifications

With each notification you get four action buttons:

1. **Snooze** - Just like the previous versions, you can still snooze a notification. The item will then disappear from the unread notifications list for the defined duration.

2. **Open** - Clicking this action button will open the item of the table, from where the notification originated. Once a notification is opened, it will the state of the notification to "Read". 

3. **Mark Read** - If this option is clicked, the subject notification;s state is changed to "Read" from "Unread". The "Read" notifications list sit below the unread ones. Notice that there is no Red dot against the notification item, which signifies it is not in "Unread" state.

4. **Dismiss** - This will remove the notification from the list.

:::tip[Please note]

Once a notification is "Read", it cannot go back to the "Unread" state. Observe in the above image, there are only three action buttons.

It is now possible to change the state of all notifications and mark them as "Read" by a single click.
