## Easy Segmentation for Reminders and Mentions

The notifications interface makes it easy to find your mentions and reminders from the remaining list by filtering them into easy to access tabs.

## Header and Body are Visible in the Notification List

The notification interface shows both the header and the body (without truncation) in the notification list itself. This helps users stay ontop of messages and reminders without having to hunt them down, or navigate to them before reading their content.

## Action buttons for Notifications

With each notification you get four action buttons:

1. **Snooze** - This button will snooze the relevent notification. The item will then disappear from the unread notifications list for the defined duration.

2. **Open** - Clicking this action button will open the item on which the notification originated. Once a notification is opened, it will automatically update the state of the notification to "Read". 

3. **Mark Read** - If this option is clicked, the relevent notification's state is changed from "Unead" to "Read". The "Read" notifications list sit below the unread ones. Notice that there is no red dot against the notification item, which signifies it is not in "Unread" state.

4. **Dismiss** - This will remove the notification from the list.

:::tip[Please note]

Once a notification is "Read", it cannot go back to the "Unread" state. Observe in the above image, there are only three action buttons.
