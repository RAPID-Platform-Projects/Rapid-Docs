3. You need to fill out the three mandatory fields:

![Image showing the three mandatory fields to raise a support ticket](<Support req 3.png>)  

- Subject - This a text field. Type in the subject of your support request here. It is a best practice to keep the subject crisp and relevant so that the support team can understand and refer to the issue effectively.

- Scale - This is a dropdown field. Scale indicates the severity of the issue for the user. There are five levels of scale (in increasing order of severity). Select the most relevant scale value for your support request.

- Description - This is a free-text (multi-lines of text) field. You can use this field to describe the issue with as much details as possible.

:::tip[Please note]
Description is  a richtext field. Therefore, you can use formatting options and also add images etc. as we do in a text editor.

To enter text editor mode, just click on the arrow icon at the top right corner of the Description field.

:::info[Please note]
The Submit button shall become active only when all the three the fields are populated. Otherwise it remains in the inactive state.

Once the support request is submitted successfully:

a. A success message will be displayed in the Support Chatbot panel.

:::note[Please note]
The email will display the subject of your support request, appended with a system generated number. The email will also have a "Go to chat" button. If you click on "Go to chat" button, it will open the Microsoft Teams chatroom, which will connect you to the support team. The support team can ask you more relevant questions here, and you can use the chatroom to provide more details about the issue.
