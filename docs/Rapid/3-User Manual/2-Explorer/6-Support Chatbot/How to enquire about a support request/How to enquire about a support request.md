## Chatbot Disclaimer

:::danger Warning:
The support chatbot is powered by a large language model AI, and as such it can at times report false information. This bot is ***not*** intended to serve true up to date information, it should only be used as a means to get to real information found in our documentation, or for very basic queries about support tickets.

This bot cannot and will never create, edit or delete any data.

Support tickets are created through a form on the support bot page, the bot itself cannot change data. 


The AI chatbot will hallucinate and lie about completing actions.
Below we can see the chatbot lies about closing a ticket. It can access up to date information about ticket statuses, but can never change them.
