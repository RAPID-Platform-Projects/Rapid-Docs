# Tasks

## What are Tasks?

There is a unique category of item in Rapid called a **Task**. This is a special item used to track work within a company. All Rapid sites come packaged with a *Tasks Table*, and *Task Item* functionality.

Tasks can also be "Completed", unlike regular items. Completing an item means that it will cease to appear in most Tables and Views. There are two methods of completing a Task. You can learn more about **Task** items by visting the link below.
