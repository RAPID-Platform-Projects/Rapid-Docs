# Tasks

## What are Tasks?

There is a unique category of item in Rapid called a **Task**. This is a special item used to track work within a company. All Rapid sites come packaged with a *Tasks Table*, and *Task Item* functionality.

**Tasks** can also be "Completed", unlike regular items. Completing an item means that it will cease to appear in most Tables and Views. You can learn more about **Task** items by visiting the link below.

- [Creating, Editing, and Deleting Tasks](</docs/Rapid/2-Rapid Standard/1-Tasks/creating-editing-and-deleting-tasks/creating-editing-and-deleting-tasks.md>)

There are two main methods of viewing your Rapid **Tasks**. The first method (using **Explorer**) will be explained in detail within this article. You can also read about an alternative method in the following article: [Tasks as a Standalone Experience](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/9-Tasks/Tasks-Experience.md>)

### Benefits

Using **Tasks** via [Explorer](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/0-navigating-explorer/0-navigating-explorer.md>) has several benefits:

- **Tasks** are presented with a similar UI to the rest of the Rapid site.
- **Tasks** can be viewed without navigating away to another web application
- Your System Administrator can design task reports using [PowerBI](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/3-Pages/2-Page Components/PowerBI/1-powerbi-report.md>) to help visually analyse bottlenecks, efficient workers, or other tasks-related data.

## Tasks via Explorer

<!-- Is this phrasing correct @MattFranklin-Rapid?-->

This is the other method of engaging with **Tasks**. The Tasks application is also interconnected with Rapid's other main applications: [Explorer](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/2-Explorer/0-navigating-explorer/0-navigating-explorer.md>), [Designer](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/3-Designer/1-what-is-designer/1-what-is-designer.md>), and [Workflow](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/4-Workflow/4-Workflow.md>).

For example:
- A list of all **Tasks** on a Rapid site can be viewed in **Explorer**.
- The layout of **Task Items** can be customised via Designer.
- Tasks can be automatically generated, assigned, or completed via **Workflow**.

### Navigating to the Tasks Portal

1. Go to the Sidebar of your Rapid site
2. Press **Tasks**

The table contains seven columns, which are (from left to right): Title, Assigned To, Start Date, Due Date, Status, and Estimated Time.](<Tasks Explorer.png>)

### Completing Tasks

As mentioned in the introduction of this article, **Tasks** are a unique type of item, in that they can be "Completed". This enables you to track all outstanding tasks, as well as the tasks you have completed.

- You can also read about the different methods of [Completing a Task via **Explorer**](</docs/Rapid/2-Rapid Standard/1-Tasks/creating-editing-and-deleting-tasks/creating-editing-and-deleting-tasks.md>).

### Further Reading

The **Tasks Portal** behaves similarly to any other Rapid **Table**. Furthermore, each task behaves as a Rapid **Item**.
