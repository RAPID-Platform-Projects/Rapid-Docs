# How to access Designer?

**Welcome to Designer -** This is your space to create your business database [**tables**](/docs/Rapid/3-User%20Manual/Glossary/glossary.md#data-table "Data Table") and organise the Rapid Platform according to your business needs.

In this guide, we will take a quick look at some of the important functions that you can perform using Designer in Rapid Platform.

**To access *Designer*:**

- Click on the Designer icon in the bottom left of the screen

As the Designer Window opens up, it will be by default on the tables page.

This is what the **Designer** screen looks like. The blue coloured left column is called the Designer [Sidebar](/docs/Rapid/3-User%20Manual/Glossary/glossary.md#sidebar "Sidebar"). The white portion lists the existing database tables.

For a newly created site, there would be no list of tables.

Please note the Designer Sidebar has collapsed design options titled - Tables, Features, Menus, Pages, Advanced.
