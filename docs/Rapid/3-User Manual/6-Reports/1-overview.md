# Reports Overview

The [reports experience](https://reports.rapidplatform.com) provides a dedicated place to view and manage PowerBI reports across your site, as well as assemble collections of reports and views into meaningful collections.

## Access

There are three main ways to get to the Reports experience

If this is your first time
1) Navigate to [https://reports.rapidplatform.com](https://reports.rapidplatform.com)
2) Enter your tenant and site names
3) Select either `RAPID Platform` for production sites, or select `Test - RAPID Platform` for test sites
4) Click Add to register your site to memory and login

On subsequent visits, you can press the View saved sites button to see a list of previously visited sites. Clicking on one of these will navigate directly.

Finally, once logged in you can bookmark the URL directly (or add it to a menu in your site!)
Reports can be 'deep linked', making it easy to share specific pages and bookmark places you frequently visit.
