# Dashboards

Dashboards provide a useful way to group a set of reports and/or views. If you find yourself looking at the same set of things in Explorer regularly, consider creating a dashboard.

## Populating a Dashboard

Dashboards store three different things; PowerBI reports, Views and Adaptive Views. These will be kept at the top of your dashboard in the form of cards. 

To add a new card:

1) Press the Add Dashboard Card button in the top right
2) Give your new card a title
3) Select the type of card you want to add

For PowerBI Reports and Adaptive Views, select an existing Report/Adaptive View against your site and press Add to finalise the card.

For Views, select the List (Table) and then select the View you want to display and press Add to finalise the card. View cards will show the count of rows within the view to make it easy at a glance to tell what is going on in a dashboard.
