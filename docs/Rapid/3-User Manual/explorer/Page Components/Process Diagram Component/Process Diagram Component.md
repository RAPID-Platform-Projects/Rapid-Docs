## **What is a Process Diagram component ?**

As the name suggests, a Process Diagram component will display the Process Diagram on a page. If this component is added properly, it will display the relevant Process Diagram associated with the item on the page.

:::danger[**Important note**]

This is a unique component and cannot be visible for every possible Page. It is only visible for specific Table Pages which have an XML type of column present.
