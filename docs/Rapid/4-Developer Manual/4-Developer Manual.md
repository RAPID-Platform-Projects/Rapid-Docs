# Developer Manual Overview

Working with the Rapid API you can do anything the front-end can do, and more!

Check out the [API Concepts](./API%20Concepts/API%20Concepts.md) for a run through of the majority of activities the API can perform.

Running into issues with User and File syncing? [Admin consent](./Setup/Admin%20Consent/Admin%20Consent.md) may be your issue.

If you're looking to create your own app to interact with the API, look into how we handle [consent and authentication](./Setup/Creating%20an%20API%20integration/generating-a-bearer-token-for-custom-applications/generating-a-bearer-token-for-custom-applications.md).
