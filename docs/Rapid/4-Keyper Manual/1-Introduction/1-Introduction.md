# Keyper Manual

The Rapid Platform is a highly customisable solution for managing business data. As a Keyper (a Key Person) you can customise your site to better reflect the business. 

## Managing Items

[Items](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/1-Tables/1-all-about-tables-in-designer/1-all-about-tables-in-designer.md) are the foundational unit of data throughout Rapid. They represent the data you want to collect, like a spreadsheet. Creating a good item ecosystem helps your Users to manage business data and keep things organised. Parts of a good item ecosystem include:
- [Tables](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/1-Tables/1-all-about-tables-in-designer/1-all-about-tables-in-designer.md) that represent the data for your business
- [Pages](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/1-all-about-pages-in-designer.md) that present and collect data
- [Views](/docs/Rapid/3-User%20Manual/2-Explorer/4-Views/4-Views.md) that filter and sort data into logical chunks

## Managing Processes

Most tasks within a business follow on from each other in broader processes. [Workflow](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/3-Workflow/1-overview/1-overview.md) provides a way to describe these processes using the popular [BPMN 2.0](https://camunda.com/bpmn/) diagramming language. These diagrams can be so accurate that Workflow can [automate the creation of tasks](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/3-Workflow/1-overview/1-overview.md) right within the system.

## Collecting Information

Sometimes you need to gather data from outside the business. [Public Forms](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/4-Adaptive%20Designer/2-How%20to%20create%20a%20new%20Adaptive%20Document%20Form/2-How%20to%20create%20a%20new%20Adaptive%20Document%20Form.md) let you write custom forms that can be sent to individuals, or hosted more publicly to collect information from 3rd parties.
