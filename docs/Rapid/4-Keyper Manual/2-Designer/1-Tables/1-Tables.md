# Tables

The purpose of Rapid Platform is to allow users to create lists and have them displayed in whatever way they desire. To achieve this, tables are used. One table correlates to an item list, and each item list correlates to a table within an SQL database. An table is a great way of grouping information. For example, a table could contain the contact information of employees, or number of stars in the sky on a particular day.

Each Table contains multiple columns (or fields) that store data of a particular type (text, date, currency, etc). Each row (called an item) on the table then represents some instance of those columns.

Rapid provides a baseline set of Tables as well as the ability to create and edit custom tables that can represent your own business data.

Tables are managed in Designer and power all of the Rapid Experiences.
