# What is a Counter component on a Layout / Page?

## **What is a Counter component?**

**Case 1:**

Imagine you are a Project Manager and frequently visit the Projects Table. At any given point in time, you want to quickly reference how many Projects are "Active" in your organisation.

OR

**Case 2:**

Imagine you are the Sales Manager. You want to always keep a sight of the number of Active Leads in the sales funnel.

In such scenarios, you can configure the Counter component.

The Counter Component can give you the ***count of items*** present in a defined **[Table View](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences-oxn/page/data-table-component-views "Data Table Component - Views")**. Therefore, for Case 1 above, you would need to :

1. Create a Table View on Projects Table that is configured to show "Active" Projects.
2. **[Add a Counter component](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-add-a-component-to-a-layout-page "How to add a component to a Layout / Page?")** to the desired **[Page](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/glossary/page/page-layout-and-component "Page, layout and component")**.

## **How to set up Counter component in Designer?**

- You can **[add the Counter component on to the Layout / Page](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-add-a-component-to-a-layout-page "How to add a component to a Layout / Page?")**. The Counter component is not present anywhere by default.

- If the Counter component is on a Grid Layout, you can [**resize and move the component over the layout**](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-arrange-a-component-on-grid-layout "How to arrange a component on Grid layout?").
- You can set the [**visibility of Counter on the Details breakpoint**](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-set-a-component-to-be-visible-hidden-on-item-details-and-create-breakpoints "How to set a component to be visible / hidden on 'Item Details' and 'Create' breakpoints?").
