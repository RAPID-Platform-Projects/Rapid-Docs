# The attachments component

## Attachments component overview

The Files Tab ([File Browser component](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/what-is-a-file-browser-component-on-a-layout-page "What is a File Browser component on a Layout / Page?")) is the place to upload / view files with reference to an item. However, in real-life business scenarios the Files Tab can a long list, and sometimes heavy files.

Attachments typically serve the need for referencing a small number of lightweight files, which can be referenced easily and frequently (in Explorer).

Attachments are visible in the [Tasks experience](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/glossary/page/task-experience "Task Experience").

## How to set up an Attachments component in Designer

- You can **[add the Attachments component on to the Layout / Page](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-add-a-component-to-a-layout-page "How to add a component to a Layout / Page?")**. The Attachments component is not present anywhere by default.

- If the Attachments component is on a Grid Layout, you can **[resize and move the component over the layout](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-arrange-a-component-on-grid-layout "How to arrange a component on Grid layout?").**
- You can set the [visibility of Attachments on the Details breakpoint](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-set-a-component-to-be-visible-hidden-on-item-details-and-create-breakpoints "How to set a component to be visible / hidden on 'Item Details' and 'Create' breakpoints?").   
    ![Visibility toggle](<../Visiblity toggle.png>)
- You can set the [visibility of Attachments on the Create Screen breakpoint](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-set-a-component-to-be-visible-hidden-on-item-details-and-create-breakpoints "How to set a component to be visible / hidden on 'Item Details' and 'Create' breakpoints?").   
    ![Display toggle](<../Display toggle.png>)

**Please note:**

- The option to Edit preferences (pencil icon) is not present in this component.
- The files uploaded in the Attachments component can be previewed using the [File Preview component](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/what-is-a-file-preview-component-on-a-layout-page "What is a File Preview component on a Layout / Page?").
- To effectively upload files in the Attachments component, it is important to have the [Document Storage (SharePoint Folder) configured in the Options Tab of the Table in Designer.](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-view-update-table-options-of-an-existing-table-in-designer#bkmrk-document-storage)
- The Attachments component, although can be added to both Individual Item Level and Group Item List Level, logically it is meaningful to have it at the Individual Item Level.
