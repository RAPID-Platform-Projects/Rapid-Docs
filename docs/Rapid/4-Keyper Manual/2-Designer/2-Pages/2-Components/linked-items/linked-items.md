# The Linked Items component

## Linked Items component overview

As the name suggests, the Linked Items component will display the list of universal [links created for the item](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-create-items-for-a-table-from-a-linked-table). The list of linked items can be viewed from within the Explorer (link icon at the top right corner).

In real-life business scenarios this space to display linked items can become cluttered and difficult to find items within. The size of the Linked Items window shown above doesn't change, which can make it difficult for the user to view and find one's relevant link here.

The Linked Items component can be easily configured on a page, providing ample space a for displaying Linked Items in an organised manner.

## How to set up Linked Items component in Designer

- You can **[add the Linked Items component on to the Layout / Page](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-add-a-component-to-a-layout-page "How to add a component to a Layout / Page?")**. This component is not present anywhere by default.

- You can set the **[visibility of Linked Items on the Details breakpoint](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-set-a-component-to-be-visible-hidden-on-item-details-and-create-breakpoints "How to set a component to be visible / hidden on 'Item Details' and 'Create' breakpoints?").
