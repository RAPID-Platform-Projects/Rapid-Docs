# The activity Feed component

## What is an Activity Feed

An activity feed can be thought of as a bulletin board or activity log for the Table Item.

The activity feed component allows users to view a timeline of previous events of the individual item including any changes that have been made or notes that have been attached.

Apart from notes, events in the life of individual item can be - creation of item and updation of item's data.

## How to set up Activity Feed Component in Designer

- You can [**add the activity feed component on to the Layout / Page**](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-add-a-component-to-a-layout-page "How to add a component to a Layout / Page?"). The Activity feed component is **[present on the Tab Strip by default](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-configure-item-details-and-item-creation "How to configure Item Details and Item Creation?").
