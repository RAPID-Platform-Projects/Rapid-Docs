# The attachments component

## Attachments component overview

The Files Tab ([File Browser component](../file-browser/file-browser.md "What is a File Browser component on a Layout / Page?")) is the place to upload / view files with reference to an item. However, in real-life business scenarios the Files Tab can a long list, and sometimes heavy files.

Attachments typically serve the need for referencing a small number of lightweight files, which can be referenced easily and frequently (in Explorer).

Attachments are visible in the [Tasks experience](/docs/Rapid/3-User%20Manual/glossary/glossary.md#task-experience "Task Experience").

## How to set up an Attachments component in Designer

- You can [add the Attachments component on to the Layout / Page](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/3-Components/1-overview/1-overview.md "How to add a component to a Layout / Page?"). The Attachments component is not present anywhere by default.

- If the Attachments component is on a Grid Layout, you can [resize and move the component over the layout](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-arrange-a-component-on-a-grid/how-to-arrange-a-component-on-a-grid.md "How to arrange a component on Grid layout?").
- You can set the [visibility of Attachments on the Details breakpoint](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints.md "How to set a component to be visible / hidden on 'Item Details' and 'Create' breakpoints?").

- You can set the [visibility of Attachments on the Create Screen breakpoint](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints.md "How to set a component to be visible / hidden on 'Item Details' and 'Create' breakpoints?").

**Please note:**

- The option to Edit preferences (pencil icon) is not present in this component.
- The files uploaded in the Attachments component can be previewed using the [File Preview component](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/3-Components/file-preview/file-preview.md "What is a File Preview component on a Layout / Page?").
- To effectively upload files in the Attachments component, it is important to have the [Document Storage (SharePoint Folder) configured in the Options Tab of the Table in Designer.](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/3-Components/attachments/attachments.md)
- The Attachments component, although can be added to both Individual Item Level and Group Item List Level, logically it is meaningful to have it at the Individual Item Level.
