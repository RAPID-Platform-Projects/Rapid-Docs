# Counter

## Counter component overview

**Case 1:**

Imagine you are a Project Manager and frequently visit the Projects Table. At any given point in time, you want to quickly reference how many Projects are "Active" in your organisation.

OR

**Case 2:**

Imagine you are the Sales Manager. You want to always keep a sight of the number of Active Leads in the sales funnel.

In such scenarios, you can configure the Counter component.

The Counter Component can give you the ***count of items*** present in a defined [Table View](/docs/Rapid/3-User%20Manual/2-Explorer/3-Pages/2-Page%20Components/Board/Board.md#changing--creating--editing-view "Table Views"). Therefore, for Case 1 above, you would need to :

1. Create a Table View on Projects Table that is configured to show "Active" Projects.
2. [Add a Counter component](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-add-a-component/how-to-add-a-component.md "How to add a component to a Layout / Page?") to the desired Page
