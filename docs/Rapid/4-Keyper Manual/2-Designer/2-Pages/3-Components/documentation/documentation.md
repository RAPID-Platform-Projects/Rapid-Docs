# Documentation

When you need to present static text on a page, you make use of the Documentation Component.

For example, Stationary Inc has set up a leave request form and found many people would ask the same questions about how to fill it in. To help users understand exactly what to do, a small explainer was written adjacent to the form that covered most of the basic concerns.

## Configuring Documentation

To set up documentation on a page:

- [Add a Documentation component](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-add-a-component/how-to-add-a-component.md "How to add a component to a Layout / Page?") to the page.

- If the Documentation component is on a Grid Layout, you can [resize and move the component over the layout](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-arrange-a-component-on-a-grid/how-to-arrange-a-component-on-a-grid.md "How to arrange a component on Grid layout?").

- You can set the [visibility of Documentation on the Details breakpoint](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints.md "How to set a component to be visible / hidden on 'Item Details' and 'Create' breakpoints?").

    ![Visibility Toggle](<../Visiblity toggle.png>)

- You can set the [*visibility of Documentation on the Create Screen breakpoint](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/2-Designer/2-Pages/5-how-to-guides/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints/how-to-hide-components-on-breakpoints.md "How to set a component to be visible / hidden on 'Item Details' and 'Create' breakpoints?"), this is particularly useful if you have a lot of documentation that doesn't fit on the creation screen.

    ![Display Toggle](<../Display toggle.png>)
- You can write the documentation for the component by clicking on the Edit (pencil) icon.
