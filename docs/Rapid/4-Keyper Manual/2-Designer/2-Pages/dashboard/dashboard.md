# The Dashboard

Once the site has been created, you will be directed to the Explorer Dashboard. The Dashboard is completely customisable as it utilises Rapid's paging system where a User can add any component and layout to any page.

The below image illustrates the view and state of the Rapid Site immediately after creation. Notice the Dashboard is empty as it has yet to be created

\##Configuring the Explorer dashboard To configure the Explorer dashboard you will need to navigate to the main dashboard and proceed to navigate to the [Designer experience](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/Home/User-Documentation/Designer) which is where the majority of the design and site configuration is done through. To navigate to Designer you will first need to go to the main Dashboard.

*Create Page Interface*

After pressing create page you will now have to select what sort of layout you wish to display on the page. In this example an image will be used. To achieve this, press 'Add a Layout' and choose 'Image' in the nav bar.

After pressing the image component, it will immediately be added to the page where you can configure, resize and re-position it.

 *Image Configuration*

Now, add an image to the component. This particular component accepts an image URL. Rapid will stretch the image to fill the size of the image component which is defined by the user if the user defines the image to 'zoom to fill'.

Unless you save the page after making changes to the page, no changes will be committed. Once the page is saved, you can now set the Title of the Dashboard. Currently the only way to set the title of the Dashboard after creation is to reload the page. After a page reload the title of the dashboard can be edited and saved.

Once the Dashboard title has been set you are now able to view the completed page in Explorer, navigate back to the main dashboard by clicking the Rapid Logo and open the Explorer experience.
