# How to send emails from SendGrid with a Menu button

This is configurable on both the ***[Side Bar](/docs/Rapid/3-User%20Manual/Glossary/glossary.md#sidebar)*** and ***[Command Bar](/docs/Rapid/3-User%20Manual/Glossary/glossary.md#command-bar)*** menu types.

SendGrid is an application which can be integrated with Rapid site and used to send emails to desired recipients.

For example -   
Imagine you are going through the list of candidates who have applied for a job position. You are eliminating profiles that do not qualify for the job. You wish to send them a Standard Regret Letter by clicking on the menu button from the data table.

Refer to [**sending static SendGrid email from Menu button.**](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/5-Omnichannel/SendGrid/5-dynamic-menu-intro/5-dynamic-menu-intro.md "Sending Static Email from SendGrid using Explorer Menu Button")

OR

Imagine you wish to send an email to selected candidates, for the next round of interview. You have a SendGrid template and want to customise it dynamically with name of the candidate and interview date in the email.

Refer to [**sending dynamic SendGrid email from Menu button.**](/docs/Rapid/4-Keyper%20Manual/5-Omnichannel/SendGrid/5-dynamic-menu-intro/5-dynamic-menu-intro.md "Sending Dynamic Email from SendGrid using Explorer Menu Button")
