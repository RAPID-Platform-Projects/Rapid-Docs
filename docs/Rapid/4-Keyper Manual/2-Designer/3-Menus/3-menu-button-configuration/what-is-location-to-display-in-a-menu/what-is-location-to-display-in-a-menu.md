# Location to Display

This is configurable on the ***[Command Bar](</docs/Rapid/3-User Manual/glossary/glossary.md#command-bar>)*** menu type.

![Location to Display config location](<Location to Display configuration location.png>)

This option has three radio buttons:

- Table
- Item
- Both

The default option selected is **Both.**

As the button appears in the Explorer view of the data table, the system allows you to configure, whether you wish to have the button at the table level OR at the item level OR at both the levels.

If, for instance, you select *Table* in this option, then the button will appear on the table only. You can select multiple rows and then click the menu button for a bulk operation.

However, if you select *Item* in this option, then the button will appear only at the item level. You can select an item, go to its details view and then click the menu button, making it a single item operation.

## Selecting Table
