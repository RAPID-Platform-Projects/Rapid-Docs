# Adding Users to Roles

Roles are a useful way to organise task assignment between multiple people. For example, the Rapid Business Modules framework uses Roles to allocate tasks from the WHS processes to the members of the WHS Role. Adding Users to this Role would then grant them access to see and manage these tasks without needing to re-configure each workflow.

This article will walk you through creating a new role and adding members. In our example Stationary Inc is growing and needing to manage the Warehouse activities between two staff members, Kenneth and Marcia.

## Creating the Role

1) Navigate to the Principals table in your site. By default this can be found under the System -> Settings -> Users & Groups menu in Explorer.

4) Press Create to add the new Role to the site

## Adding team members
