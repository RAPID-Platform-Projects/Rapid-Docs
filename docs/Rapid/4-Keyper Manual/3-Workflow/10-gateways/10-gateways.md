# Gateways

**Gateways** require at least one input and one output connection for the Gateway to be configured properly. To configure a **Gateway**, select it on the **Canvas** and configure it using the [Properties Panel](</docs/Rapid/4-Keyper Manual/3-Workflow/3-drawing-diagrams/3-drawing-diagrams.md>). Below is a list of all **Gateway** types and their functionality.

| Element Type | Symbol | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Exclusive Gateway** | ![A screenshot of how the "Exclusive Gateway" appears on the canvas. The Gateway is a diamond shape, with an x symbol inside.](<Gateway Exclusive.png>) | Will only allow the token to travel down a single connection, dependent upon whichever condition in its list of conditions are fulfilled first. If no condition can be fulfilled, the process will continue along the [default flow](</docs/Rapid/4-Keyper Manual/3-Workflow/11-flows/11-flows.md#default-flow>) path. This element is particularly useful for joining incoming flows together. |
| **Parallel Gateway** | ![A screenshot of how the "Parallel Gateway" appears on the canvas. The Gateway is a diamond shape, with an + symbol inside.](<Gateway Parallel.png>) | Will allow the token to travel down all outgoing flows. Each outgoing path is evaluated if it contains a condition, and then it is executed independently of the other paths. This element can also be used for joining multiple incoming flows: the element will wait until all incoming pathways are ready. |
| **Inclusive Gateway** | ![A screenshot of how the "Inclusive Gateway" appears on the canvas. The Gateway is a diamond shape, with a circle inside.](<Gateway Inclusive.png>) | Will active one or more outgoing flows, depending on the conditions attached to each path. |
| **Complex Gateway** | ![A screenshot of how the "Complex Gateway" appears on the canvas. The Gateway is a diamond shape, with an asterisk (*) inside.](<Gateway Complex.png>) | This is not supported at the time of writing.|
| **Event Based Gateway** | ![A screenshot of how the "Event Based Gateway" appears on the canvas. The Gateway is a diamond shape, with an pentagon inside.](<Gateway Event Based.png>) | Will only work with two or more outputs. Each output *must* be connected to an [Intermediate Event](</docs/Rapid/4-Keyper Manual/3-Workflow/6-intermediate-events/6-intermediate-events.md>). The process will wait until one of the **Intermediate Events** immediately downstream from this Gateway activates, then the flow will travel along that path. All other outputs from this gateway will be discarded.|
