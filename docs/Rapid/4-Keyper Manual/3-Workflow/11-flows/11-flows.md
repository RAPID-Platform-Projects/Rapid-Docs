# Flows

Tokens that are generated by **Start Events** in a process diagram will follow the flow of a diagram. The flow, or direction, that the tokens will travel is dependent on the direction of sequence flow and default flow elements.

## Sequence Flow

A **Sequence Flow** will move the token in the direction of the arrow. **Sequence Flows** are the default link between elements in a **Workflow Process**. They can be changed to **Default** or **Conditional Flows**, which are explained below.

## Default Flow

A **Default Flow** is the path the token will take if no other path is available. This helps prevent errors from occurring, such as if a **Gateway** has no pathway conditions that could be fulfilled.

To create a **Default Flow**:
1. Select a **Sequence Flow** that is connected to a **Gateway** or **Border Event**, by clicking on it
2. Select the **Edit** button that will appear

The flow connection has a dotted box around it, indicating that it is selected. Two yellow circles indicate the start and finish of the arrow. The edit button resembles a wrench.](<Flow Edit Button.png>)

3. Choose *Default Connection* from the list

## Conditional Flow

A **Conditional Flow** is created when conditional logic is applied to **Sequence Flow**. A token will not move along a **Conditional Flow** unless its conditions are met.

To create a **Conditional Flow**:

1. Create a flow or link between items using the **Global Connect** tool in the [Toolbar](</docs/Rapid/4-Keyper Manual/3-Workflow/2-drawing-tools/2-drawing-tools.md>), or via the [Configuration Panel](</docs/Rapid/4-Keyper Manual/3-Workflow/4-element-types/4-element-types.md#configuring-an-elements-type>).

2. Select the flow connection by clicking it on the **Canvas**

3. In the [Properties Panel](</docs/Rapid/4-Keyper Manual/3-Workflow/3-drawing-diagrams/3-drawing-diagrams.md>), select the configuration rules for the element.
