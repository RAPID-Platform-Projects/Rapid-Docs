# Drawing Tools

This section will focus on the drawing tools included in the **Workflow** application.

When you open a process diagram in the **Workflow** application, all of the diagram-drawing tools will be located in the left-hand toolbar.

Each of the tools are discussed in detail below, in the order that they appear in the toolbar.

| Tool Name | Icon | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hand** | ![A screenshot of the "Hand" tool in Workflow. The icon resembles a human hand.](<Diagram Tool Hand.png>) | **Used for dragging on the canvas to reposition the "camera" of the editor.** Note that to scroll across the canvas, you can also: click-and-drag on the empty white canvas background; hold **Space** on your keyboard and move the mouse; or position your mouse at the edge of the canvas to scroll towards that edge. |
| **Lasso** | ![A screenshot of the "Lasso" tool in Workflow. The icon resembles a crosshair with a box beneath it.](<Diagram Tool Lasso.png>) | **Useful for selecting multiple components at once.** Click-and-drag to draw a boundary box, and release to select the items inside the boundary box. |
| **Create / Remove Space** | ![A screenshot of the "Create/Remove Space" tool in Workflow. The icon resembles a two parallel lines, with arrows indicating that they are moving apart.](<Diagram Create Space Tool.png>) | **Useful for repositioning an item or groups of items.** The cursor will become a crosshair with a dotted x and y plane extending from the cursor. Clicking and dragging either vertically or horizontally will create or remove space along the chosen axis. |
| **Global Connect** | ![A screenshot of the "Global Connect" tool in Workflow. The icon resembles two parallel arrows pointing to the upper right. The top arrow is made of a single, unbroken line. The lower arrow is made of a dotted line.](<Diagram Tool Connect.png>) | **Used for connecting objects together.** Note that selecting on an object in the canvas will also display this tool in the pop-up. |
| **Start Event** | ![A screenshot of the "Start Event" tool in Workflow. The icon resembles a simple circle.](<Diagram Tool Start.png>) | **Place a Start Event on the canvas.** Start events can be triggered by a variety of conditions. When a start event is triggered it creates a "token". This token moves along the workflow process, down the assigned global connections and to the tasks or other events. To configure this event: select it once the object is placed on the canvas, and press the wrench icon.. |
| **Intermediate / Boundary Event** | ![A screenshot of the "Intermediate/Boundary Event" tool in Workflow. The icon resembles a circle with another circle inside it.](<Diagram Tool Intermediate.png>) | **Place an Intermediate or Boundary Event on the canvas.** These events can be triggered by a variety of conditions. To configure this event: select it once the object is placed on the canvas, and press the wrench icon.. |
| **End Event** | ![A screenshot of the "End Event" tool in Workflow. The icon resembles a circle with a bold outline.](<Diagram Tool End.png>) | **Place an End Event on the canvas.** This event causes the token to be terminated and closes the workflow process. |
| **Gateway** | ![A screenshot of the "Gateway" tool in Workflow. The icon resembles a diamond shape.](<Diagram Tool Gateway.png>) | **Place a Gateway on the canvas.** A gateway can have logic assigned to it, and causes the token to divert down a number of paths depending on the logic applied. To configure object event: select it once the object is placed on the canvas, and press the wrench icon.. |
| **Task** | ![A screenshot of the "Task" tool in Workflow. The icon resembles a rectangle with rounded corners.](<Diagram Tool Task.png>) | **Place a Task on the canvas.** Typically a task is either assigned to the Rapid System to complete, or assigned to a specific user to complete. To configure this object: select it once the object is placed on the canvas, and press the wrench icon. |
| **Expanded Sub-Process** | ![A screenshot of the "Sub-Process" tool in Workflow. The icon resembles a rectangle with rounded corners. In the centre of the rectangle is a small square with a line inside it.](<Diagram Tool Subprocess.png>) | **Place a sub-process on the canvas.** This is a process within a process, and is useful for completing necessary small tasks while the main task is running. |
| **Data Object Reference** | ![A screenshot of the "Data Object Reference" tool in Workflow. The icon resembles a sheet of paper with the upper-right corner folded in.](<Diagram Tool DataObjectReference.png>) | **For diagramming purposes**. The Data Object Reference doesn't perform any automation role. Instead, it is sometimes useful for indicating to a person reading the diagram that a file is being manipulated, generated, etc. |
| **Data Store Reference** | ![A screenshot of the "Data Store Reference" tool in Workflow. The icon resembles a database icon: i.e. a cylinder standing upright and sliced into smaller sections.](<Diagram Tool DataStoreReference.png>) | **Place a Data Store Reference on the canvas.** Also known as **Data Cans**, this object allows you to access items from specific tables. The database's items can also be changed or updated using a this object. |
| **Pool / Participant** | ![A screenshot of the "Pool / Participant" tool in Workflow. The icon resembles a rectangle with a "header" section on its short left side.](<Diagram Tool Pool.png>) | **Place a Pool / Participant on the canvas.** Also known as **Swim Lanes**, these allow you to organise your workflow. A common practice is to have Data Cans in the top row; then to have system tasks, events, and processes in the centre row; and finally, to have user tasks in the bottom row. Using this method, you can see at a glance all of your data, system processes, and people processes. |
| **Group** | ![A screenshot of the "Group" tool in Workflow. The icon resembles a square with rounded corners. The square is also drawn with a dotted line.](<Diagram Tool Group.png>) | **For diagramming purposes.** This object doesn't perform any automation role. Instead, it helps group together items in a container to either highlight them, or indicate that they are closely connected. |
