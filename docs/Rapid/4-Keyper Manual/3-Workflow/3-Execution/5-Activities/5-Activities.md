# Activities

**Activities** represent work that needs to be completed. Activitys can generate Activity items for users or for Rapid's system to complete. Below is a list of the different **Activities** and their functionality.

| Element Type | Symbol | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Abstract Activity** |![A screenshot of a default activity element. The activity is a rounded rectangle that is empty inside.](Task.png)| This type of task cannot be configured or automated. It is useful for documentation purposes only. |
| **Send Activity** |![A screenshot of a "Send Activity" element. The activity is a rounded rectangle that has a black envelop inside, in the upper-left corner.](<Task Send.png>)| This uses Omnichannel to send messages. At the time of writing, this can only be configured to send emails via SendGrid. For this element to be configured correctly, SendGrid must be configured on your Rapid site. |
| **Receive Activity** |![A screenshot of a "Receive Activity" element. The activity is a rounded rectangle that has a white envelop inside, in the upper-left corner.](<Task Receive.png>)| Receives a message from SendGrid or Omnichannel. SendGrid must be configured on your Rapid site.|
| **User Activity** |![A screenshot of a "User Activity" element. The activity is a rounded rectangle that has a symbol of a person inside, in the upper-left corner.](<Task User.png>)| Generates a a [User Activity](</docs/Rapid/4-Keyper Manual/3-Workflow/8-tasks/user-task/user-task.md>) or project for a user to complete. This activity can be configured with a *Title*, *Adaptive Document*, a static or dynamic *Assignee*, a *Parent Activity*, a *Start Date*, a relative *Due Date*, and a *Description*. The activity can also send an email communication to a relevant user so they are informed about the activity being generated. |
| **Manual Activity** |![A screenshot of a "Manual Activity" element. The activity is a rounded rectangle that has a hand inside, in the upper-left corner.](<Task Manual.png>)| This is a activity that cannot be configured. Drawing a **Global Link** from this activity downstream to a **Data Store Reference**, will allow you to click the global link and configure the link to update an item or items in the **Data Store Reference**. This is called "modifying a data output association".|
| **Business Rule Activity** |![A screenshot of a "Business Rule Activity" element. The activity is a rounded rectangle that has a table or spreadsheet icon inside, in the upper-left corner.](<Task Business Rule.png>)| This element cannot be configured. It is a [BPMN 2.0](https://www.bpmn.org/) symbol and useful for documentation only. |
| **Service Activity** |![A screenshot of a "Service Activity" element. The activity is a rounded rectangle that has a symbol of two cogs inside, in the upper-left corner.](<Task Service.png>)| Triggers a [Service Activity](</docs/Rapid/4-Keyper Manual/3-Workflow/8-tasks/service-task/service-task.md>). The type of service activity can be configured. |

The specific **Start Event** that will be triggered can be configured from this activity. |

Note that a **activity** can also be configured into a **sub-process**.
