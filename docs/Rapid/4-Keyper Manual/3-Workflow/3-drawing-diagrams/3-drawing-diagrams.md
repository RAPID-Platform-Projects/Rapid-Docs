# Drawing Diagrams

When you open a new **Process Diagram** in **Workflow**, the user interface will resemble the following image:

![A screenshot of the Workflow application and its user interface. At the top of the site is the Command Bar, which contains buttons and functions such as saving, editing, zooming in and out, etc. On the left-hand side of the site, next to the Sidebar, is the Toolbar. The toolbar contains all of the drawing buttons, which are represented by icons. In the centre of the image is a "Canvas" where the process diagram will be drawn. Currently, only a circle exists in the canvas. On the far right side of the site is the "Properties Panel", where objects can be edited or coded.](<Diagram Canvas.png>)

| Section | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Command Bar | Here is where the buttons for editing the **Process Diagram** as a whole exist. For example, the following buttons here are (from left to right): Save, Editing the **process**'s Name and Details, Zoom Out, Zoom In,  Download Diagram, Review **Process Runs**, Open Process Runs in Explorer, the Inline Refresh, and the **Launch Process** buttons. |
| Toolbar | Here are where the buttons for drawing the **Process Diagram** can be found. The [specific buttons and their functions are discussed here](</docs/Rapid/4-Keyper Manual/3-Workflow/2-drawing-tools/2-drawing-tools.md>).|
| Canvas | This is where the process diagram will be drawn. |
| Properties Panel | This is where each element or object in the **Process Diagram** can be configured or have its inputs and outputs scrutinised. To view an object in the **Properties Panel**, first click on the object on the canvas. Clicking the background of the canvas will cause the Properties Panel to display the properties of the entire **process diagram** instead. |

## Adding Elements

There are two methods for adding a diagram element onto the page.

### Using the toolbar

1. Select the diagram element on the toolbar

2. You will notice that an orange element has now been attached to your cursor

![A screenshot demonstrating that once a toolbar button is pressed, a shape will appear in orange below the cursor. In this example, the mouse cursor has selected the rectangle "Task" element. Below the cursor (partially cut off by the toolbar) is the orange task element ready to be placed.](<Workflow Click Toolbar.png>)

3. Now when you move your mouse, the shape will also move as well. Your cursor may also change to a fist, to indicate that it is "holding" the element you selected.

![A screenshot demonstrating how the cursor will change while dragging an element. The mouse cursor resembles a fist clenching onto the rectangle task shape below it.](<Workflow Drag Object.png>)

4. Position the element on the canvas, and then click to place it. Once the element is placed, the following will occur:
    - The shape's outline will change from orange to black.
    - A dotted outline will appear around the element, indicating that it has been selected.
    - A series of additional buttons will appear as icons beside the element.
    - A flashing cursor in the centre of the element will indicate that you can type text into the centre of the element.

![A screenshot demonstrating the appearance of an element once it has been placed on the canvas. The element now has a black rectangle outline, rather than an orange one. Further out from the element's edge, a dotted rectangle surrounds the element, indicating that it has been selected. Inside the task element, a vertical line cursor is blinking, indicating that text can be typed here. To the right of the task element is a series of button represented by icons. These will be described in more detail later in the article.](<Workflow Placed Object.png>)

:::notes[Repositioning]
You can reposition an element after it is placed, by clicking and dragging on the element. You will not be able to reposition an element if it is expecting you to type a label (i.e. the text cursor is flashing in the centre of the element). In this case, you will need to de-select the element first, and then it can be dragged as usual.

## Aligning Elements

**Workflow**'s UI will indicate whether two elements are aligned while you are dragging an element to place it. Note that when to objects are aligned correctly, a yellow line will appear and bisect the two objects, indicating that they are aligned along that axis.

![A screenshot demonstrating how the UI will change to indicate that an element is aligned with another element. In this example, a task is being dragged into place beside a start event element. Because the items are aligned, a yellow line has appeared that horizontally bisects the two objects, indicating that they are both in alignment.](<Workflow Aligned Objects.png>)
