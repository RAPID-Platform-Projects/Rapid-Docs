# Element Titles

Elements can have a *Title* added. Adding titles to your elements will improve the readability of your process and assist with troubleshooting. If no titles are added to a diagram, the diagram will be difficult to read and understand.

This then is linked via an arrow to a User Task in the middle (a rounded rectangle with the icon of a person in the upper left). This is finally linked to an End Event on the right (a circle with a thick outline). The purpose of this image to to communicate that this diagram is difficult to comprehend without labels added.](<Workflow Element No Titles.png>)

In this example, a Signal Start Event has the title "Wait for Workflow to be trigged by Menu Button" beneath it. It connects to a Task element with the title "Create Task for Manager", which finally connects to an End Event element with the title "End Process".](<Workflow Element Titles.png>)

Large elements (such as Tasks) will display their titles within the element's symbol. Smaller elements (such as **Start Events** or **End Events**) will display their title text underneath the element symbol.

There are several methods for adding a title, which are explained below.

## Adding Titles via Keyboard Shortcut

To add a title to an element:

1. Select an element by clicking it

2. Press **E** on the keyboard

3. Type the desired title into the element

4. Confirm the title by:
    - Pressing **Enter** or **Return** on your keyboard, or
    - Clicking on the **Canvas**

## Adding Titles When an Element is Placed

After an element is placed, Workflow's UI immediately will prompt you to give the element a title.

Further out from the element's edge, a dotted rectangle surrounds the element, indicating that it has been selected. Inside the task element, a vertical line cursor is blinking, indicating that text can be typed here. To the right of the task element is a series of button represented by icons. These will be described in more detail later in the article.](<Workflow Placed Element.png>)

1. Type the desired title into the element

2. Confirm the title by:
    - Pressing **Enter** or **Return** on your keyboard, or
    - Clicking on the **Canvas**

## Adding Titles via the Properties Panel

Certain element types will display information in the **Properties Panel**. For example, a basic task (with no icon) will not allow the user to edit the tasks properties. However, the **User Task** element can be configured. Selecting a **User Task** will allow you to edit the *Title* in the **Properties Panel**.

1. Select an element by clicking it on the **Canvas**
2. Ensure the **Element** tab is selected in the **Properties Panel**
3. Edit the the title using the *Title* field
4. Confirm the title by:
    - Pressing the **Save** button in the top toolbar
