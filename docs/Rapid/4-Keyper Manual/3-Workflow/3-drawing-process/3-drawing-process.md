# Drawing Process

When you open a new **Process Diagram** in **Workflow**, the user interface will resemble the following image:

![A screenshot of the Workflow application and its user interface. At the top of the site is the Command Bar, which contains buttons and functions such as saving, editing, zooming in and out, etc. On the left-hand side of the site, next to the Sidebar, is the Toolbar. The toolbar contains all of the drawing buttons, which are represented by icons. In the centre of the image is a "Canvas" where the process diagram will be drawn. Currently, only a circle exists in the canvas. On the far right side of the site is the "Properties Panel", where objects can be edited or coded.](<Diagram Canvas.png>)

| Section | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Command Bar | Here is where the buttons for editing the **Process Diagram** as a whole exist. For example, the following buttons here are (from left to right): Save, Editing the **process**'s Name and Details, Zoom Out, Zoom In,  Download Diagram, Review **Process Runs**, Open Process Runs in Explorer, the Inline Refresh, and the **Launch Process** buttons. |
| Toolbar | Here are where the buttons for drawing the **Process Diagram** can be found. The [specific buttons and their functions are discussed here](</docs/Rapid/4-Keyper Manual/3-Workflow/2-drawing-tools/2-drawing-tools.md>).|
| Canvas | This is where the process diagram will be drawn. |
| Properties Panel | This is where each element or object in the **Process Diagram** can be configured or have its inputs and outputs scrutinised. To view an object in the **Properties Panel**, first click on the object on the canvas. Clicking the background of the canvas will cause the Properties Panel to display the properties of the entire **process diagram** instead. |
