# Changing Element Types

The **Workflow Toolbar** only contains the "base" types of diagram element. For example, using the **Toolbar** you can place a **Task**, but not a **User Task**. In order to configure an element and change its type, we must use the **Configuration Panel** once the element is placed on the **Canvas**.
