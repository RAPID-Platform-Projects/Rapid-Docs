# Element Types

The **Workflow Toolbar** only contains the "base" types of diagram element. For example, using the **Toolbar** you can place a **Task**, but not a **User Task**. In order to configure an element and change its type, we must use the **Configuration Panel** once the element is placed on the **Canvas**.

To configure the type of element:

1. Select an element by clicking on it

2. Press the **Change Type** button on the **Configuration Panel**. The **Change Type** button has an icon of a wrench.

3. From the menu that appears, select a type of element

In this example, the user is configuring a Start Event. The options that appear are as follows (from top to bottom): "Intermediate Throw Event", "End Event", "Message Start Event", "Timer Start Event", "Conditional Start Event", and the mouse cursor is hovering over the final option, which is the "Signal Start Event"; this event has an icon of a circle with a triangle inside it. ](<Workflow Change Type Button Menu.png>)

4. The element will now be configured to that type, and its appearance will change to reflect this new type
