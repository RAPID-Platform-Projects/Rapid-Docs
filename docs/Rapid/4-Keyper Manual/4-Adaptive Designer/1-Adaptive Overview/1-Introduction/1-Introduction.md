# Introduction

**Adaptive Documents** allow you to quickly build web forms to collect data, and seamlessly integrate it with your Rapid database. You can send forms to clients to collect data, or use them to power your daily internal operations.

Forms can be built quickly using the powerful **Elements Hierarchy**. You can also natively connect your form to the columns in your Rapid site.

In the middle section, the elements are arranged for a "Report Incident" form. In the rightmost section, there is an inspection panel where the attributes of each web form field can be set.](<Adaptive Example.png>)

With **Adaptive Documents** you can: 

- Create forms that are both desktop and mobile-friendly
- Build items across many tables in your database
- Create QR codes or URLs to share your form with the public
- Generate a personalised form for a recipient
