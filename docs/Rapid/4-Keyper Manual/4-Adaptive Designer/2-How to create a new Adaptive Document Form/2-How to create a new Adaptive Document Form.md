You need to consider the following:

4. Title - This is the name of the Adaptive Form. This is a text field, so you can enter any title that logically depicts your form's purpose.

5. Type - Select Form in this dropdown field.

6. Classification - This is a dropdown field with options as -   

- Draft - select this option to indicate that the form is being developed.   
- Published - this option indicates that the form is currently used in the site. 
- Archived - this option is selected when the form is no loner needed or used.

You may select the one that best suits your classification of form; however, "Draft" is the most used classification.

:::info[Please note]
The classifications are like labels for the ease of organisation only. They do not impact the functionality of the form.

7. Description - You can describe the objective of the form here. It would help for future references.

8. Post filling all the data, you can click on "Confirm".

The Adaptive Form Canvas will open. Your title will now appear on the top left area of the form canvas.
