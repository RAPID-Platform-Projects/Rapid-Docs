# Understanding Adaptive Document Canvas

Let us take a quick overview of the various elements of the Adaptive Document Canvas. Before we continue, it is important to note that Adaptive provides the feature to open more than one form simultaneously. However, only one of these open forms remain active with its components visible on the canvas.

Let us take a look at the various elements of the Adaptive Form Canvas.

The above image labels various constituents on the canvas:  

<!-- TODO add smaller preview sections to assist --->

1. The **file menu** gives you option to open an existing form or create a new form. Opening / creating a form adds it to the workspace section (defined in 2). You can also save, delete or clone forms using the file menu.

    ![A zoomed-in view of the larger screenshot earlier. This is a screenshot of the file menu button. It has light blue text that reads "File", on a dark blue background.](1.png)

2. This area holds the **title** for all open forms. We can refer to this as the **Workspace section**. You can click on any of the titles to activate the relevant form and edit it.

    ![A zoomed-in view of the larger screenshot earlier. This is a screenshot of the Workspace section. It contains two forms: "General Leads Form" and "Marketing Request"](2.png)

3. This is the **title** of active form. The system highlights the same with a light blue colour and a tick mark indicating that it is the active form. It is important to note that there can be one and only one active form in the workspace section.  

    ![A zoomed-in view of the larger screenshot earlier. This is a screenshot of the "Marketing Request" form item. It is blue, with a blue checkmark on the left and an x for closing it on the right.](3.png)

:::tip[Please note]
You can close an active form by clicking on the "X" icon on the right side of the active form's title. Closing a form removes it from the workspace section. To close a form, you need to make it active by clicking on it once.

4. Clicking on this icon brings you to the **Edit Mode** of the active form. You can create or modify the elements of the active form, when in Edit mode.  

    ![A zoomed-in view of the larger screenshot earlier. This is a screenshot of the "Edit Mode" icon. it is white because it is currently selected, and looks like a stylised ruler with a stylised pencil on top.](4.png)

5. Clicking on this icon brings you to the **Preview Mode** depicting how the form may appear outside designer canvas.  

    ![A zoomed-in view of the larger screenshot earlier. This is a screenshot of the "Preview Mode" button. The icon resembles a blue eye on a dark blue background.](5.png)

:::note[Please note]
You can toggle between **Edit** and **Preview Modes** by clicking on their respective icons. The passive mode will appear in blue, while the in-action mode will appear in white.

In the above image, the active form ("Marketing Request") is in Edit mode (because the icon appears in white).

6. This arrow icon can be used to toggle the appearance of Workspace section. Users may want to toggle off (or, collapse) the Workspace section typically when the Form Structure is too long.

7. There are two tabs here - **Elements** and **Overview**. When Elements tab is active, then you can see the tree of elements for the form (defined in 8). When overview tab is active, then you can see and modify information about the form - like the form title, states, connections, etc.

    ![A zoomed-in view of the larger screenshot earlier. This is a screenshot of the "Elements" and "Overview" breakpoints. The work "Elements is written in dark letters, and the word "Overview" is written in light grey lettering.](7.png)

8. This is the section which appears when the **Elements** tab is active (defined in 7). You can see the **tree structure** of elements for the active form.  We can refer this as the Adaptive Document structure panel or the Tree of Elements section. This section houses all the elements added to the form. The structure may have elements nested within each other based on your desired configuration. You can scroll up and down to view all the components of the structure. You can click on any of the structural elements to view it on the Composition area (defined in 9).

    ![A zoomed-in view of the larger screenshot earlier. This is a screenshot of the element tree and its components in a list.](8.png)

9.  This is the **Composition** area. Here you can add elements and also perceive how various elements will appear visually. Please note this is different from Preview. 

    ![A zoomed-in view of the larger screenshot earlier. This is a screenshot of the composition area and the fields that will be visible in the final form.](9.png)

10. This is the **selected element**. It appears with a blue highlight. The attributes of the selected element are visible towards the right in the Element configuration panel (defined in 11).

    ![A zoomed-in view of the larger screenshot earlier. This is a screenshot of the "selected element" in the composition area of Adaptive. It has a faint blue background and a dotted line surrounding it.](10.png)

11. This is the **Element configuration panel**. Depending on the nature of the element, this panel will display different configuration categories.

    ![A zoomed-in view of the larger screenshot earlier. This is a screenshot of the "element configuration panel" section of Adaptive. It contains sections that are outlined below.](11.png)

12. These are the configuration categories, which include:
    a. **Attributes** - allows the user to define how the element appears
    ![A zoomed-in view of the larger screenshot earlier. This is a screenshot of the "attributes" section in the "element configuration panel". In this example, the only option that is current set is the "Label", which is set to "Title".](12a.png)
    
    b. **Conditions** - defines logic which governs when the element can be enabled, or appear, etc.
    
    ![A zoomed-in view of the larger screenshot earlier. This is a screenshot of the "conditions" section in the "element configuration panel". In this example, the only option that is current set is the "Label", which is set to "Title".](12b.png)
    
    c. **Validation** - is used to set element-level validation criteria. This can be used for preventing users from submitting the form when there are empty fields, or unusual data is entered
    
    ![A zoomed-in view of the larger screenshot earlier. This is a screenshot of the "validation" section in the "element configuration panel". In this example, the only option that is current set is the "Label", which is set to "Title".](12c.png)
    
    d. **Connection** - defines which tables in the database are connected to the elements on the form

    ![A zoomed-in view of the larger screenshot earlier. This is a screenshot of the "connection" section in the "element configuration panel". In this example, the only option that is current set is the "Label", which is set to "Title".](12d.png)
    
    e. **Event** - defines what actions can be triggered when clicking button elements 

    f. **Choice** - defines the choices that will appear in a dropdown or choice elements

Based on the nature of the elements selected, configuration categories will appear in the **Element configuration** panel (defined in 11).

13. This is the button to toggle between the dark and light mode appearance.

    ![A zoomed-in view of the larger screenshot earlier. This is a screenshot of the lightmode/darkmode button. It has an icon of a blue sun or a dark blue background.](13.png)
