## Common Features 

Although every control has its own unique features, there are certain characteristics shared by all controls. These are:

![Image showing element id, title and icon](<Common features.png>)

**Element ID** - Every control when added to the composition area as an element gets a system generated Element ID. This is the element's identification from the system. Two elements based on same control will have different ids. ***You cannot change an Element ID.***

**Element Title** - You can define every element a title, irrespective of its nature. While an Element ID is a system generated string identifier for an element, an Element Title will help you better identify the elements as you can name them logically.

Every element has a title. If you have not manually set the title, the default title is the name of the control.
