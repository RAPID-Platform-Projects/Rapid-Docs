# Designing an Adaptive Document form

This article introduces the various options that will assist you in designing a basic Adaptive Form.

For the sake of simplicity, let us take the example of a newly created blank form. <a href="https://rapiddocs.z8.web.core.windows.net/docs/Rapid/Keyper%20Manual/Adaptive%20Designer/How%20to%20create%20a%20new%20Adaptive%20Document%20Form/" target="_blank">**Click here**</a> to learn about how to create a new Adaptive Document Form.

As you successfully create a form with a title, you will see a white rectangle in the Composition area (as shown in the below image). Also observe that the Document Structure panel shows "Layout.Section root".

The white rectangle corresponds to the root section of the layout. As we will discuss now, all the elements and sections are added under this root section. 

## Configuring the Root Section properties in Configuration Panel

Before we get into constructing our first form by adding and configuring elements, the first step is to be aware of the Root Section properties.

To learn how to configure attributes of root section <a href="https://rapiddocs.z8.web.core.windows.net/docs/Rapid/Keyper%20Manual/Adaptive%20Designer/How%20to%20configure%20Attributes%20of%20Root%20Section/" target="_blank">**click here**</a>.

You can also establish a connection of the root section with data table.
