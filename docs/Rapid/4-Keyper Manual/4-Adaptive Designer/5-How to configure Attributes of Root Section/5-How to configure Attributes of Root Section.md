2. Observe the <a href="https://rapiddocs.z8.web.core.windows.net/docs/Rapid/User%20Manual/glossary/#element-configuration-panel-adaptive-documents" target="_blank">**configuration panel**</a> opens. It has "root" written above it.

Also observe there are three categories:
- Attributes
- Conditions
- Connection

Out of these you can only configure Attributes here. Conditions and Connection cannot be configured from this panel for root.

4. Let us describe each of the options for the Attributes category :
