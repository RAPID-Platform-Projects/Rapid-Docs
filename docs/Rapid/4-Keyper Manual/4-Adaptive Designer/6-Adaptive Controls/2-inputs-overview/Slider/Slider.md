# Slider

## What is a Slider input control?

A **slider** allows the user of the Adaptive Document to enter an integer. However, this is helpful when users are required to quickly and intuitively set a value within a specified range without typing. Interacting with a slider, users get immediate visual feedback on their selection, which can help in making more informed decisions. Sliders  allow users to fine-tune values, providing precision in input. 

:::note[For Example]
Imagine you are creating a Project Details form. The Project Manager shall use this form to record the project requirements and expectation. There is a field to enter Project Budget for marketing phase of a new project launch. The Project Manager can easily drag and adjust the budget between minimum and maximum values - $7,500 and $20,000.

Both the <a href="https://docs.rapidplatform.com/docs/Rapid/Keyper%20Manual/Adaptive%20Designer/Adaptive%20Controls/inputs-overview/Rating/" target="_blank">**Rating control**</a> and Slider control are similar in nature, however, their functional applicability may be different. The Rating control is used where the user needs to input a _rating_ i.e. a smaller number out of a larger number (like 3 out of 5). Typically, minimum value of a rating is 0 and maximum is a small integer. 

The Slider control, on the other hand, allows the user to visually adjust the value between a minimum and maximum numbers. Both minimum and maximum numbers can be large (in comparison to Rating) integers.

Both Rating and Slider controls hold the value as a Whole number. However, a <a href="https://docs.rapidplatform.com/docs/Rapid/Keyper%20Manual/Adaptive%20Designer/Adaptive%20Controls/inputs-overview/Number%20OR%20Decimal/" target="_blank">**Whole number control**</a> is different as it allows the user to type and enter integers (unlike visual selection of values as in case of Rating and Slider).
