## What is a Currency input control?

A currency control allows the user of the Adaptive Document to enter a monetary figure. 

For example: Imagine you are creating a quote for a client. You want to display the amount and taxation component in the quote. In such cases a simple number field would not serve the requirement.

:::info[Please note]  
The currency control serves the specific requirement for entering monetary figures. A number 100.50 is ambiguous when it comes to representing monetary figures. AU$ 100.50 is accurate and is distinctly different from Â£ 100.50. Hence, the currency control is used specifically where user inputs monetary figures.

The currency control is built over the <a href="https://rapiddocs.z8.web.core.windows.net/docs/Rapid/Keyper%20Manual/Adaptive%20Designer/Adaptive%20Controls/inputs-overview/Number%20OR%20Decimal/" target="_blank">**Number control**</a>. This article will discuss only the aspects that are different from the Number control. 

Hence, to gain a comprehensive understanding of currency control, it is recommended that you refer the article on <a href="https://rapiddocs.z8.web.core.windows.net/docs/Rapid/Keyper%20Manual/Adaptive%20Designer/Adaptive%20Controls/inputs-overview/Number%20OR%20Decimal/" target="_blank">**Number control**</a> .

 :::warning[Please note]  
 The keyword search is with reference to the symbol and not the currency title. For example, you cannot type Australian Dollar to get AU$.
