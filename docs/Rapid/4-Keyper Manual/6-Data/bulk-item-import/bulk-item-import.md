# Walkthrough : Importing many items

Building off the [quickstart](../6-Data.md#quickstart), this walkthrough will demonstrate importing a large (over 250 items) amount of data into your site. This example is built off Stationary Inc, a small demo business that manufactures and sells stationery. Recently they have had a successful marketing campaign which has generated several hundred new leads. These leads have been exported from their campaign system as a spreadsheet and now we are intending to import these new leads into the site.
