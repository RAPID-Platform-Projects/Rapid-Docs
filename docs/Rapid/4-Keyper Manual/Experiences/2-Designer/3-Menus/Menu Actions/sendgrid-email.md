This is configurable on both the ***[Side Bar](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/glossary/page/sidebar)*** and ***[Command Bar](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/glossary/page/command-bar)*** menu types.

SendGrid is an application which can be integrated with Rapid site and used to send emails to desired recipients.

For example -   
Imagine you are going through the list of candidates who have applied for a job position. You are eliminating profiles that do not qualify for the job. You wish to send them a Standard Regret Letter by clicking on the menu button from the data table.

Refer to [**sending static SendGrid email from Menu button.**](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/sending-emails-via-rapid-platforms-using-sendgrid/chapter/sending-static-email-from-sendgrid-using-explorer-menu-button "Sending Static Email from SendGrid using Explorer Menu Button")

OR

Imagine you wish to send an email to selected candidates, for the next round of interview. You have a SendGrid template and want to customise it dynamically with name of the candidate and interview date in the email.

Refer to [**sending dynamic SendGrid email from Menu button.**](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/sending-emails-via-rapid-platforms-using-sendgrid/chapter/sending-dynamic-email-from-sendgrid-using-explorer-menu-button "Sending Dynamic Email from SendGrid using Explorer Menu Button")
