# How to customise Sidebars using Menus?

***[Sidebars](</docs/Rapid/Keyper Manual/Glossary/> "Sidebar")*** can be very useful in organizing pages and navigating to the required ones quickly.

## Overview

Customizing the Explorer sidebars is one of the most fundamental things an organization can do to ensure that system matches their business requirements. The sidebar is how all users will interact with and navigate Explorer. It is very advantageous, if you can collect all the related pages under one category. For example - we can have all of our Accounting related pages and tables nested neatly under the Accounting section. In addition to go multiple layers deep in the nesting of menu items.

## Accounting Example:

## Customizing the Explorer Sidebar:

In this example we want to move the **Contacts** menu item to be nested under the **CRM** menu item. The steps below will show you how to do so.

1. Navigate to Designer &gt; Menus &gt; Explorer  
    ![Navigate to Explorer Menu](<../Navigate to Explorer Menu Config.png>)
2. In the Explorer Sidebar Structure side panel drag and drop the desired menu item to its desired position by clicking and holding on the three horizontal lines  
    ![Drag Menu Item](<Drag Menu Item.png>)
3. Press Save
4. Observe the menu item has now been moved  
    ![Observe menu is now changed](<Observe altered menu.png>)
