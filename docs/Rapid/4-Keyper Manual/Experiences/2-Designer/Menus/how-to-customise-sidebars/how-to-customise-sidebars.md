# How to customise Sidebars using Menus?

***[Sidebars](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/glossary/page/sidebar "Sidebar")*** can be very useful in organizing pages and navigating to the required ones quickly.

## Overview

Customizing the Explorer sidebars is one of the most fundamental things an organization can do to ensure that system matches their business requirements. The sidebar is how all users will interact with and navigate Explorer. It is very advantageous, if you can collect all the related pages under one category. For example - we can have all of our Accounting related pages and tables nested neatly under the Accounting section. In addition to go multiple layers deep in the nesting of menu items.

## Accounting Example:
