# How to delete a Layout from a Page?

## **What does deleting a layout mean?**

Imagine you have created a **[Page](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/glossary/page/page-layout-and-component "Page, layout and component")** on Customer data. You have **[added a layout](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-add-a-layout-to-a-page "How to add a Layout to a Page?")** to the page which has a few [**components**](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/experiences/page/how-to-add-a-component-to-a-layout-page "How to add a component to a Layout / Page?") depicting customer complaints.

However, now you no longer want to see the customer complaints data on the Page.

OR

You wanted to add a Grid Layout, however, by mistake added a Horizontal Layout to the Page.

In such cases, you would want to delete the subject layout from the Page.

Each layout in Rapid Platform provides the option to delete it from the layout / page.

**Please note -**

- Once deleted the layout would no longer be visible and will lose all its properties / settings. If you wish to have the subject layout back on the Page, you will have to add it and configure it again, afresh.
- When you delete a Layout, all the components added to the Layout will be deleted as well.

## **How to delete the Layout?**

Every layout has a horizontal options panel at the top or bottom right corner of its boundary. Look for the "X" icon.

As you click on this icon, the layout will immediately disappear from the Page. However, you must "Save" the Page in order to make delete effective.

Please refer to the below video for illustration.
