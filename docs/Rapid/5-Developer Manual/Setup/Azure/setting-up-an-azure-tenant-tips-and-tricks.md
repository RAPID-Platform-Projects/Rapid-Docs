# Setting up an Azure tenant tips and tricks

Use these instructions to create an Azure tenant.

For a smoother sign-up experience, it is recommended to sign up with your browser in Incognito mode and to be using a non-Microsoft email address. This email will not be the admin user. You will set up the admin user later in the process.

The admin user signs in using what looks like an email address, however it does not need to be connected to an inbox. Because of this two-factor authentication for an admin account is done through an authentication app on a phone such as Google Authenticator.

Make sure you select "NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT" otherwise the account will be billed a large fee each month and these are non-refundable.
