This allows the HR team to quickly see the engagement and loyalty of staff by department based on the eNPS Score (See [Employee Engagement Process](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/human-resources/page/employee-engagement-process-enps-questionnaire) for a breakdown of the eNPS score and what it means).\n\n### How to Access the Employee Engagement Dashboard\n\n1. Navigate to Human Resources &gt; Employees  \n    [![image-1703651698901.png](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-12/scaled-1680-/Wjh9cXTQiFM15MwK-image-1703651698901.png)](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-12/Wjh9cXTQiFM15MwK-image-1703651698901.png)\n2.

The attributes available to “slice” by are Month, Year, and Department.\n\nFor example, you could use the slicers to filter down the visuals to 2024 for the Finance department.\n\n[![image-1703656169527.png](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-12/scaled-1680-/jmHUqKdXmQWwWAj2-image-1703656169527.png)](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-12/jmHUqKdXmQWwWAj2-image-1703656169527.png)\n\n### Questionnaires Sent and Responses Received\n\nThis section of the report contains two subsections: Cards and the Questionnaires Sent vs Responses received graph.\n\n##### Cards\n\nThe Cards section within the Questionnaires Sent and Responses section offers concise reference statistics.

To do this simply click on the “Drill Up” arrow on the top right of the visual. To move back from the “Year” view to the “Month” view click on the “Drill Down” button and select the year you wish to drill down to.\n\n[![image-1703656301112.png](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-12/scaled-1680-/wGwPTrbxFgVVVmA1-image-1703656301112.png)](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-12/wGwPTrbxFgVVVmA1-image-1703656301112.png)\n\n#### eNPS Overview\n\nThis section of the report contains two subsections: Cards and the eNPS by Department graph.\n\n##### Cards\n\nThe Cards section within the Questionnaires Sent and Responses section offers concise reference statistics.
