From this question the percentage of “detractors”(those who answer 0 to 6), “neutrals” (those who answer 7 or 8), and “promotors” (those who answer 9 or 10) are calculated.\n\nFinally, the eNPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detracts from promotors. This results in a score between -100 and 100. A good eNPS score depends on the industry and the context, but generally, scores between 10 and 30 are considered good, while scores between 50 and 70 are considered excellent.\n\n### How to send out the eNPS Questionnaires:\n\n1.
