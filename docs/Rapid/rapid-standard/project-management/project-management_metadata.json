This process enables internal and external stakeholders to individually approve each project deliverable and objective while seamlessly providing feedback. This mechanism ensures that projects achieve their intended goals and establishes a documented communication channel between internal and external reviewers.\n\nThe process is triggered manually from within the project item you which to “Wrap-Up” as described below.\n\n### How to trigger the Wrap-Up Project Process\n\n1.

They can assess the objectives and deliverables as \"Outstanding,\" \"Accomplished,\" or \"Partially Accomplished.\" They can also provide comments on each item.\n2. **Client Review of Objectives and Deliverables:** Following the internal review, an email will be sent to the client's email address containing a form that outlines each objective and deliverable. The client will follow a similar process, evaluating each item as \"Incomplete,\" \"Complete,\" or \"Partially Complete.\" They can also offer comments.\n3. **Generate Wrap up Document:** A wrap up document will then be generated containing the internal reviewer’s and client reviewer’s comments. A sharelink to this document will be emailed to both parties for easy access.","name":"Project Wrap-Up / Sign-Off Process","created_at":"2023-12-27T23:32:05.000000Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T23:34:41.000000Z","url":"https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/project-management/page/project-wrap-up-sign-off-process"}
