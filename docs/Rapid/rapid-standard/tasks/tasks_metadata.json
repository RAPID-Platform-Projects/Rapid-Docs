This report grants stakeholders the capability to view tasks based on the assigned user or their status, offering comprehensive oversight at both organizational and employee levels regarding task statuses.\n\n#### Task Dashboard\n\n##### Accessing the Task Dashboard:\n\n1. On the Explorer sidebar click on Tasks &gt; Task Reporting  \n    [![image-1702441524758.png](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-12/scaled-1680-/cN8jSPl7RQXbcYAp-image-1702441524758.png)](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-12/cN8jSPl7RQXbcYAp-image-1702441524758.png)\n\nThe Task Dashboard is divided into four sections: slicers, cards, and the Task Table.\n\n**<u>Slicers</u>**\n\nSlicers provides the user with the ability to filter all of the visuals on the page by a specific attribute and can be found at the top of the page.\n\nThe Tasks Dashboard can be “sliced” based on no attributes, one attribute, or multiple attributes. The attributes available to “slice” by are Status and Assigned To.\n\nFor example, you could use the slicers to filter down the visuals to Tasks that are assigned to “John Doe” with a status of “Not Started”.\n\n[![image-1702442422648.png](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-12/scaled-1680-/b6GPDAQtUIM8X76N-image-1702442422648.png)](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-12/b6GPDAQtUIM8X76N-image-1702442422648.png)\n\n**<u>Cards</u>**\n\nThe Cards section within the Invoices and Bills report offers concise reference statistics. The values of these cards will change based on the slicers or if selections are made on tables or charts.\n\nThe provided cards are as follows:\n\n- Outstanding Tasks – Displays the number of tasks that are “Not Started” or “In Progress”\n- Overdue Tasks – Displays the number of tasks that are “Not Started” or “In Progress” and have passed their “Due Date”\n\n[![image-1702442442254.png](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-12/scaled-1680-/ZmPZRSHiBFPXZH23-image-1702442442254.png)](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-12/ZmPZRSHiBFPXZH23-image-1702442442254.png)\n\n**<u>Task Table</u>**\n\nThe Task Table displays the Task, Assigned To, Start Date , Due date, Status, Overdue (Red Flag = Overdue, Green Flag = On Track), Days Over, and link to the rapid item.\n\nIt is an interactive visual, allowing users to click any bill line and the report visuals will highlight or filter based on the selected bill.\n\n<div class=\"pointer-container\" id=\"bkmrk-%C2%A0\"><div class=\"pointer anim is-page-editable\"><svg class=\"svg-icon\" data-icon=\"link\" role=\"presentation\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"></svg><div class=\"input-group inline block\"><input id=\"bkmrk--2\" placeholder=\"url\" readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\"></input> <button class=\"button outline icon\" data-clipboard-target=\"#pointer-url\" title=\"Copy Link\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"svg-icon\" data-icon=\"copy\" role=\"presentation\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"></svg></button></div><svg class=\"svg-icon\" data-icon=\"edit\" role=\"presentation\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"></svg></div></div>[![image-1702442519760.png](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-12/scaled-1680-/tEuSSuY0zEb76JDb-image-1702442519760.png)](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-12/tEuSSuY0zEb76JDb-image-1702442519760.png)","name":"Task Reporting","created_at":"2023-12-13T04:42:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T04:42:37.000000Z","url":"https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/tasks/page/task-reporting"}
