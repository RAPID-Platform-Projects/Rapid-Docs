This is great for doing simple math and concatenations. Such as “Profit” = “Sales Price” – “Revenue”. When creating an SQL query, these columns WILL appear when accessing the table directly.\n\nSubqueries on the other hand are similar to computed columns in that that they can perform math and concatenations but can also use information from OTHER tables. The information on a subquery field is NOT stored in the database but is rather calculated when you load that table. Because these are NOT stored in the database it means that if you access the table directly (using the example query below) subquery columns will not be present. HOWEVER, there is a way you can access these.\n\n[![image-1693353755307.png](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-08/scaled-1680-/Ti02VkIiSmIcthEP-image-1693353755307.png)](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-08/Ti02VkIiSmIcthEP-image-1693353755307.png)\n\nWhen you load a table in RAPID, it shows the subqueries, this is called a VIEW. You can access a view using SQL and that way all of the subquery columns will be present and you DO NOT need to recalculate them in powerBI.\n\nThis does come with a trade off in that it is more tolling on the database, which is generally, by default, we advise accessing the database table and not the database view. However, if the subqueries are relatively simple, it should not be too tolling. See example below of accessing a view:\n\n[![image-1701755730324.png](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-12/scaled-1680-/lkpBdRraGNtgxGYa-image-1701755730324.png)](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/uploads/images/gallery/2023-12/lkpBdRraGNtgxGYa-image-1701755730324.png)\n\n##### **Related article**\n\n[Creating a Financial / Fiscal Year Calendar Table - Template](https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/powerbi/page/creating-a-financial-fiscal-year-calendar-table-template)","name":"Accessing Calculated Columns and Subqueries in an SQL Query - Tables and Views: What is the difference?","created_at":"2023-08-29T23:58:50.000000Z","updated_at":"2023-12-06T05:31:52.000000Z","url":"https://docs.rapidplatform.com/books/external-applications/page/accessing-calculated-columns-and-subqueries-in-an-sql-query-tables-and-views-what-is-the-difference"}
