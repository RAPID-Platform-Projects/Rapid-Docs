# The Sidebar

The **sidebar** is the main method for navigating around your site.

You can minimise or expand the sidebar by clicking the arrow at the top.

Clicking on the **Rapid** logo in the upper left will return you to the site dashboard.

Along the sidebar are menu buttons. There are several things that a menu button can do:

- Folders have a chevron to show they can be expanded. When a folder is clicked, it will display its contents.
- Menu buttons can also be links to specific pages in your Rapid site. These will not have a chevron.

To close a menu folder or folders, click away elsewhere on the site.

## Experience Buttons

At the bottom of the sidebar are three **experience buttons**. These buttons allow you to navigate to a different Rapid experience.

### Explorer

- Allows you to view the data in your site
- Allows you to edit, add, or delete data
- Has an icon of a **house** to represent "home". This is because it is the experience you will use the most.

### Workflow

- An advanced experience, that allows you to automate processes for your business
- An icon of a **flowchart** is used to represent the programming interface that Workflow uses.

### Designer
- Allows you to build the site that is visible in Explorer (e.g. new pages, new tables, new menu buttons, etc.)
- Has an icon of a **ruler and a set square** because it is used to design new data structures and interfaces for your site.

:::note[Returning to the Dashboard]
If you ever become lost while navigating through your site, you can click on the **Rapid logo** in the sidebar to return to the **Explorer** experience, and its **Dashboard** page.

As discussed, in this workshop we will be focused on understanding **Explorer**.
