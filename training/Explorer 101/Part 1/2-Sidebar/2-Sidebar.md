The **sidebar** is the main method for navigating around your site.

You can **minimise** or **expand** the sidebar by clicking the chevron in the upper right.

Clicking on the **Rapid** logo in the upper left will return you to the site dashboard.

![A screenshot of a sidebar from Rapid Standard as an example. The sidebar is dark blue and has the Rapid name and logo at the top. Underneath are a list of menu items that will navigate the user. The menu items from top to bottom are: Organisation, Tasks, Assets, CRM, Finance, Projects, Human Resources, WHS, Policies, Support, and System. At the very bottom of the sidebar are buttons to navigate between core applications. This is explained further below.](<Explorer sidebar.png>)

Along the sidebar are menu buttons. There are several things that a menu button can do:

- Menu buttons can act as Folders. Folders have a chevron to show they can be expanded. When a folder is clicked, it will display its contents.
- Menu buttons can also be links to specific pages in your Rapid site. These will not have a chevron.

## Experience Buttons

At the bottom of the sidebar are three **experience buttons**. These buttons allow you to navigate to a different Rapid experience.

### Explorer

- Allows you to view the data in your site
- Allows you to edit, add, or delete data
- Has an icon of a **house** to represent "home". This is because it is the experience you will use the most.
- You can read detailed documentation for **Explorer** in the [Explorer User Manual](</docs/Rapid/User%20Manual/Explorer/navigating-explorer/>)

### Workflow

- An advanced experience, that allows you to automate processes for your business
- An icon of a **flowchart** is used to represent the programming interface that Workflow uses.
- You can read the introductory documentation for **Workflow** in the [Workflow User Manual](</docs/Rapid/User%20Manual/Workflow/>)

### Designer

![A screenshot of the Designer experience button at the bottom of the Sidebar. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to indicate the location and appearance of the button. The button contains an icon of a ruler and set-square.](<Designer Nav.png>)

- Allows you to build the site that is visible in Explorer (e.g. new pages, new tables, new menu buttons, etc.)
- Has an icon of a **ruler and a set square** because it is used to design new data structures and interfaces for your site.
- You can read the introductory documentation for **Designer** in the [Designer User Manual](</docs/Rapid/User%20Manual/Designer/what-is-designer/>)

:::note[Returning to the Dashboard]
If you ever become lost while navigating through your site, you can click on the **Rapid logo** in the sidebar to return to the **Explorer** experience, and its **Dashboard** page.

As discussed, in this workshop we will be focused on understanding **Explorer**.
