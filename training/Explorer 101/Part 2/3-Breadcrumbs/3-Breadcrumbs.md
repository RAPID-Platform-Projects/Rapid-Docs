# Breadcrumbs

The **Jumbotron** is found at the top of all pages within **Explorer**.

The Jumbotron displays the current Page's title, as well as a series of *Breadcrumbs* showing previous navigation steps. When viewing a Table, the Table's name will be presented in the breadcrumbs; in an item context, the item's title will be displayed.

:::note[Terminology]
The term "Breadcrumbs" comes from the fairytale *Hansel and Gretel* collected by the Brothers Grimm. In the story, the two children leave breadcrumbs behind them to find their way home. In web design, this term has come to mean a series of links that allow you to return to previous webpages that you have visited. Essentially, this type of component allows you to "retrace your steps".

![A screenshot of the breadcrumbs section of the Jumbotron. The screenshot is annotated with a red box to highlight the series of links know as "breadcrumbs". The series of links reads: "Employees > Wanda Jones". The words "Wanda Jones" are bold, an annotation explains that this is the current page name (item) and represents the current page being viewed. These words do not act as a hyperlink, as they are the current page. The word "Employees" is written in regular text. An annotation explains that this is the previous page name (for a table) and represents the table where the item is stored. Clicking this word would cause the user to be navigated back to the table.](<Jumbotron Breadcrumbs.png>)

The current page will be rendered in the *Breadcrumbs* as bold text, and cannot be clicked. Previous pages, however, will be rendered as regular text, and can be clicked on.
