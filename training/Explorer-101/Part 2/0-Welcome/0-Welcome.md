# Welcome

Welcome to the second workshop in the Rapid Training Package. This workshop is aimed to teach the beginner-friendly basics of working within the Rapid Explorer experience.

## Recap

In the [previous training package](</training/Explorer 101/Part 1/0-Welcome/0-Welcome.md>), we discussed the following:
- How to navigate **Explorer** (using the Sidebar and its menus)
- What **Tables** and **Views** are, and why are they important
- **How to find data** using tables and views

## Topics Covered

In this training package, we will learn about the following key concepts:

- How to **navigate inside** items on a table
- How to see the **files** and **activity history** that is contained within each item
- How items can be **linked** together to build connections between tables
- How to **create** new items, or **edit** and **delete** existing items in your Rapid site

:::note[Note]
This demonstration uses the **Employees** table from our Rapid Business product, as this is a simple table for demonstration purposes.

If you haven't purchased Rapid Business, you can still benefit from this training, but won't be able to follow the process we use here exactly.

## Further Documentation

Each of these topics above are also covered in our **User Manual** documentation. However, this training package will aim to introduce each of these topics clearly and quickly. At the bottom of each lesson, several links to the User Manual will be provided if you would like additional information.
