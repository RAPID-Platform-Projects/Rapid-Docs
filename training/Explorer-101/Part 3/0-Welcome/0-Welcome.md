# Welcome

Welcome to the third workshop in this Rapid Training Package. This workshop is aimed to teach the beginner-friendly basics of working within the Rapid Explorer experience.

## Recap

In the [previous training package](</training/Explorer 101/Part 2/0-Welcome/0-Welcome.md>), we discussed the following:
- How to **navigate inside** items on a table
- How to see the **files** and **activity history** that is contained within each item
- How items can be **linked** together to build connections between tables
- How to **create** new items, or **edit** and **delete** existing items in your Rapid site

## Topics Covered

In this training package, we will learn about the following key concepts:
- What **tasks** are, and why they are important
- Creating, editing, and deleting tasks
- Tasks can be automatically generated by processes

:::note[Note]
This demonstration uses the **Tasks** table from our Rapid Business product.

If you haven't purchased Rapid Business, you will still benefit from this training, because the **tasks** table is packaged with all version of Rapid Platform by default.

## Further Documentation

Each of these topics above are also covered in our **User Manual** documentation. However, this training package will aim to introduce each of these topics clearly and quickly. At the bottom of each lesson, several links to the User Manual will be provided if you would like additional information.
