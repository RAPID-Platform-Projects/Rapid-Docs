Welcome to the training package for **Extending and Customising Modules** in Rapid Standard. This course is specifically created for System Builders and is intended to provide you with essential training at the foundational level.

This course intends to help you get started with customising the Rapid Platform. At the end of this course, you will be able to make basic customisations or extensions to Rapid Standard's basic modules.

Before you begin this customisation workshop, it is recommended that you are first familiar with the <a href="https://rapiddocs.z8.web.core.windows.net/docs/Rapid/Rapid%20Standard/Assets/base-assets-and-subtypes/" target="_blank">Assets Module</a> of Rapid Standard. This workshop will use the Assets module as a basis to teach you how Rapid Standard can be customised for your business's needs.
