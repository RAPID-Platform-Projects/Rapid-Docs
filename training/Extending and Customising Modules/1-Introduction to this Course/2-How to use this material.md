# How to use this training material?

The learning objective of this Foundational Training course is to instill confidence among System Builders with reference to Rapid Platform operations.

This course is structured across modules. 

1. **Adding Tables and Table Subtypes** - In this module we will examine what table subtypes are, and why you would want to build one.

2. **Adding Columns to Extend a Module** - Here, we will explore how new columns can be built into tables or table subtypes, as well as examine how to enter data into these columns.

3. **Integrating a New Table** - This section will walk you through the necessary steps that follow table creation. It will examine how to create new views, and how to display a new table in the Explorer sidebar.

Across these modules, you will find tasks which are based on the knowledge acquired in the lessons prior to it.

We have provided a test environment for you to carry out these tasks and actually get a feel of how system elements are built in Rapid Platform.

## Scenario

Imagine you are the system builder for a manufacturing company called *Stationery Inc.* This company produces writing materials, school supplies, and office supplies. Its product line includes envelops, writing notepads, pens, pencils, erasers, letterheads, etc. 

The clients for *Stationery Inc.* are segmented into three groups - primary and secondary education institutions, small businesses, and corporations. *Stationery Inc.* has also recently forayed into Publishing.
