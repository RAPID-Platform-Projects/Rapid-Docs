1.	So, let’s go back to the ALL-TABLES view, by pressing the tab at the top. Now, let’s hit the CREATE TABLE button. First, we need to name the table. We should give it a plural name because it is a collection of similar items. So, we will call it COFFEE MACHINES. Coffee Machines are a type of asset, so we are going to tick the “Create Sub-Type” button to inherit the columns from the ASSETS table. We then choose the ASSETS table from the drop-down menu. 
2.	The best part of making a table is that you get to choose an icon.  So, let’s see if I type coffee in here. Awesome! I’m going to choose the coffee cup. Lastly, we must choose where our table items and files will be stored in SharePoint . I’m going to choose Base Rapid > Documents which is the main documents folder, and I want Rapid Platform to create neat folders for me behind the scenes, so I’ll press the checkbox.
3.	Okay, now we can see all the columns that were in ASSETS have been inherited into the Coffee Machines table. Look at all these columns we don’t have to build! Hours of work saved.
