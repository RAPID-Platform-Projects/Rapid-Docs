1.	If we look at how this column was built, we can see it is a LOOKUP field, which means it looks at another table (in this example it looks at the employees in the company) and creates a link to one of those employees. 
2.	Great. Let’s try making a lookup column ourselves. We can now create a new column using the CREATE COLUMN button. Maybe we will also set an employee who is responsible for going out and buying the beans. We can title this column BEAN GOPHER, make its column type a LOOKUP column, and tell it to show us the EMPLOYEES from the EMPLOYEES table.
3.	We just want to choose the employees by their name, so we can leave Column as Full Name. Alternatively, you could use an Employee ID number or something else if needed. Let’s save the column. 

### Opening the Created Table
1.	If we go up here and press the EXPLORER button, which looks like a web browser and a magnifying glass, we can see our brand new, empty table. 
2.	Another way we can access our new table is from our sidebar. You may have to refresh the page, but you’ll now see the table we created has been added to the sidebar.
