# How to use this training material

The learning objective of this Foundational Training course is to instil confidence in System Builders so that they can design and implement new features for their Rapid Business site.

This course is structured across several sections. 

1. **Customising an Existing Table**

    In this section we will examine how to customise and extend a table that is packaged with Rapid Standard's **Assets** module. Here, we will explore how new columns can be built into tables, as well as how to enter data into these columns.

2. **Creating New Tables and Subtype Tables**

    How to build new tables and table subtypes, and how to implement large changes to a Rapid module.

3. **A Challenge**

    The training material will conclude with a challenge that will test everything you have learned.

## Scenario

Across these modules, you will also find smaller challenges which are based on the knowledge acquired in the lessons prior to it. Each of these challenges will be contextualised using the following scenario:

:::info[Scenario]
Imagine you are the system builder for a manufacturing company called *Stationary Inc.* This company produces writing materials, school supplies, and office supplies. Its product line includes envelops, writing notepads, pens, pencils, erasers, letterheads, etc. 

The clients for *Stationary Inc.* are segmented into three groups: education institutions, small businesses, and corporations. *Stationary Inc.* has also recently forayed into Publishing.

Keep this scenario in your mind moving forward, as the training will be based on this context.
