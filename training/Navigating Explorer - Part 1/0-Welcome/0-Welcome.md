Welcome to the first workshop in the Rapid Training Package. This workshop is aimed to be our most foundational session and will teach the beginner-friendly basics of working within the Rapid Explorer experience.

## Topics Covered

In this training package, we will learn about the following key concepts:

- How to navigate **Explorer** (using the Sidebar and its menus)
- What **Tables** and **Views** are, and why they are important
- **How to find data** using tables and views

## Further Documentation

Each of these topics above are also covered in our **User Manual** documentation. However, this training package will aim to introduce each of these topics clearly and quickly. At the bottom of each lesson, several links to the User Manual will be provided if you would like additional information.
