# Tables

Rapid uses a **database** to store information.

At the risk of oversimplifying: you can think of a database like a collection of files or spreadsheets that are connected to each other.

In this section, we will examine the concept of a **Table** (what it is, and why it's important).

## What is a Table?

Most databases use **tables** to organise and store information.

In Rapid, you can open **tables** to view their information.

Tables are divided into vertical **columns** (similar to a spreadsheet). This allows all the data placed onto a table to be organised.

Tables contain horizontal **rows**. These are also referred to as **items**.

### An Example Table

| | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Item 1** | Data | Data | Data |
| **Item 2** | Data | Data | Data |
| **Item 3** | Data | Data | Data | 

If we wanted to create a table that records an employee's name, date of birth, and email address, we could build a table like so:

![A screenshot of a simple table that contains three employees, their dates of birth, and their email addresses. For example: Wanda Jones, 25/06/1982, wandajones2@example.com](<Table Simple.png>)

## Why are Tables Important?

A table is the simplest way to convey a **lot of information**.

A table allows us to **categorise** that information.

:::note[Example]
For example, the *Contacts* table is where I store my company's external Contacts. So, the data on this table must be a type of Contact. I cannot (for instance) store my favourite ice cream flavours on the Contacts table.

If you have a Rapid Business site installed, you will see tables such as: *Tasks, Assets, Employees, Quotes, Invoices, Projects*, etc. Each of these table names describes the *type of data* they contain.

## How do I find the data I need?

In the **sidebar** you will find most of the tables that are packaged with Rapid business. These tables are grouped into menu folders (e.g. *Finance*, *Human Resources*, *WHS*).

You can also use **views** to help you find the relevant information on a table. We will discuss **views** on the next page.
