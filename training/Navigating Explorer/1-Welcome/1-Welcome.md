# Welcome

In this course, we will begin with the basics of using Rapid. We will discuss:

- Navigating around your site
- Creating, editing, and deleting data
- Useful terminology

## Topics Covered

1. **The Sidebar, Tables, and Views**

    To begin, we will discuss how to navigate to different Rapid pages, using the **sidebar**. Here we will explore the fundamentals of databases, and how they work. We will also learn what a **table** is, and why they are important. 
    
    In order to filter our table data and only see relevant information, we use **views**. This section explains the concept of views, and how to change your view of the data.

2. **Items**

    Here we will explore **items** in Rapid, and how they are connected to Tables and Views.

5. **Pages**

    It is worth noting that every new "screen" we see on a Rapid site is called a **page**. Here, we will discuss pages briefly.

6. **Tabs**

    Most items will contain multiple pages. Pages can be organised and displayed using **tabs**.

7. **Breadcrumbs**

    Finally, we will examine how to easily return to a previous page, using the **breadcrumbs** at the top of the site.

## Further Documentation

Each of these topics above are also covered in our **User Manual** documentation. However, this training package will aim to introduce each of these topics clearly and quickly.

At the bottom of each lesson, several links to the **User Manual** will be provided if you would like additional information.
