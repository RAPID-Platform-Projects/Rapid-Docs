# Part 2: Managing your New Leads 

## Video

Now that we've got our Leads data table and system pages sorted, we're all set to bring in those fresh leads into our CRM. 

We've got two ways to do this: manual entry, where we punch in the lead details ourselves, or the online leads form filled out by the leads themselves. 

As the CRM starts rolling in those new leads, it's time to view them in a way that's handy for effective management.  

Today, I'll walk you through setting up an extra page in the system. It'll let you check out your leads in a simple Board or List View, making it a breeze to keep an eye on and handle all those Sales Activities.
