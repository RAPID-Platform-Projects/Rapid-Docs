# Part 6: Monitoring your Opportunity Pipeline 

## Video 

Part of any effective system is the ability to view and analyse data. Now that we can record our Sales Opportunities, we will want the ability to review that data on an opportunity pipeline report. This information allows us to redirect resources where needed and identify periods of time where we may need contractors to help us complete the work. It also allows us to monitor our Sales Team and how they are tracking. 

I will demonstrate how to build the Pipeline Breakdown report using Microsoftâ€™s PowerBi. However, in the simplest explanation, the process of building a new report and getting it uploaded into Rapid Platform is this.  

1. Obtain reporting user login details to PowerBi (please see your IT Support person). 
2. Fetch the data that you are wanting to display on the report or dashboard.  
3. Build the report visuals in PowerBi. 
4. Connect the data to each of the visuals. 
5. Review and upload the report into Rapid Platform.
