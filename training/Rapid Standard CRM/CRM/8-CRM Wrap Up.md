# Part 7: CRM wrap up 

## Video

Firstly, congratulations on making it all the way through this 7-part series. 

To finish up there are a few last-minute things that we can do to improve your CRM and I thought it would be great to demonstrate a customerâ€™s journey all the way through the CRM to show you end to end how it all works together. 

**Fix Up Menus **

**Demo a Lead example.  **

Hopefully throughout the series I have shown you just how easy and flexible Rapid Platform is to configure a simple CRM for your business. 

This simplicity can be applied to any business domain so if you have any ideas of how Rapid Platform can benefit your business please reach out. 

I look forward to seeing you in another Rapid Platform video series in the future.
