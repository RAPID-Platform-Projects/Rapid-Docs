## What happens after I make a sale? 

Congratulations, now that you have made a sale you will want to convert that lead over to a customer. The way we do that is creating an Account that reflects the Company or business name as well as a Contact which would likely be the person you have been speaking to during the sales activities. 

We have a simple method for you to complete that conversion (which we will cover in a later video), however, the first step we need to complete is building up the data structures for Accounts and Contacts. In a similar way we did for Leads. 

Let’s take a quick look at Accounts and Contacts within our Training site.

Now let’s jump over to my own site to start building those tables. Again, feel free to use the Data Table References attachment to complete the tables.
