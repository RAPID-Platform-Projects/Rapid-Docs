# Introduction to Rapid Platform

## Data Management

One can argue that a large part of business management is ***data management***. It allows for efficient storage, organisation, and analysis of data, which can lead to better decision-making, improved productivity, and increased profitability.

Rapid Platform enables organisations to manage their data more efficiently. Using Rapid infrastructure, businesses can create their own custom database tables for storage and maintenance of business data.

## Reporting Insights

Furthermore, Rapid Platform can integrate with **Microsoft Power BI**, which allows users to create their own interactive data reports. These reports help business users to slice and interpret information in a more meaningful manner. 

So whether a user wants to view sales charts by geography, an employee workload report, or project status report with reference to a schedule, everything is possible via Rapid Platform.

## Process Automation

Rapid Platform additionally provides businesses with the flexibility to easily draw their own business process diagrams, which allow you to automate your business operations. Our BPMN 2.0-based business process automation engine fetches data from your database, and performs defined actions automatically. The best part is that its a low-code environment.

## Team Management

Daily business operations are often about ***team management***: delegating tasks to team members and effectively monitoring outcomes.

Rapid Platform offers infrastructure for business managers to **assign tasks** to their teams and **notify** team members. Team members can easily manage their tasks and update the status of work item or log their time-sheets using Rapid Platform.
