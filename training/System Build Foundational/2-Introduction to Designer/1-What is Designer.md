# What is Designer?

Databases are the backbone of all modern information systems.

**Designer** allows you to build infrastructure in Rapid Platform, which defines how a System Users can input, store, view and analyse data based on business needs. 

## Key elements of Designer

Designer has three primary elements:

### Data Tables 

As a powerful database management system, Rapid Platform provides you with the flexibility to **define data structures** based on your business needs, and to organise your data through them.

Using Designer, you can build your database and also set access permissions.

:::note[The Importance of Data Structures]
A well-designed **database** helps to optimise data retrieval, which can significantly improve the performance of the data processing, analytics and reporting. It also makes it easier to maintain and update data over time.

### 2. Pages

While data tables define how data will be stored in the system, **pages** govern how information will be displayed to the user.

Designer provides interface for designing the layout of your **Pages** and UI components.

### 3. Menus

Designer also allows you to create the **menus** for navigating across your site, and between your **pages**. **Menus** can be either links, or buttons that perform defined actions.
 
Menus can also provide context and hierarchy, allowing users to understand how different data tables relate to each other. By using clear and concise labels and grouping related items together, menus can help users navigate efficiently and reduce cognitive load.
