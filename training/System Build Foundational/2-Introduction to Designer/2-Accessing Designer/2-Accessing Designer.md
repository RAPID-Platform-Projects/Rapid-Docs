As the Designer Window opens up, it will be by default on the tables page.

This is what the **Designer** screen looks like. The blue coloured left column is called the Designer Sidebar. The white portion lists the existing database tables.

For a newly created site, there would be no list of tables.

Please note the Designer Sidebar has collapsed design options titled - Tables, Features, Menus, Pages, Advanced.
