# Pages

A page is a fundamental element in Rapid Platform. Consider a broad analogy of a blank page of a notebook. You can write something on a page and then this page can be read by others. In Rapid Platform, a page is an area to host components that will be viewed by users.

## Details Page and Create Screen

Whenever a data table is created, Rapid generates some default pages. One of these is the Details Page. This is a page where the user can view or edit the data of an item.

Furthermore, you can also configure the Create Screen for an item. This defines what information can be entered by the user when creating a new item.
