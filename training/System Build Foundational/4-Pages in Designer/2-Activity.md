# Activity - Configure Item Details and Create Screen

In the previous activity you had created a Table for the Sales Manager of your organisation - Stationery Inc.

Now it is time to create the infrastructure to help Sales Team to record and view data into the Data Table. You need to:

1) Provide a form which the Sales Team can use to record Lead's information.
2) Configure the page which will display the details of the recorded Lead(s).
