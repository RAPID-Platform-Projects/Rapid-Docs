# Adaptive Documents

In RAPID Platform, Explorer is the application where a company's users can input and view information. Adaptive Documents is also an interface in Rapid Platform, but different from Explorer.

It serves a similar purpose: providing an interface to input data into the system, and view information from the system. However, it provides **more flexibility**, **validity checking**, and **layout options**.

Additionally, you can **share these digital forms** with users outside your company.
