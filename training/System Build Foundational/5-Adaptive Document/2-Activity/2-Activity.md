# Activity - Create an Adaptive Form 

The Sales Team of Stationary Inc. interacts with every lead and then records their data carefully in the data table. However, the Sales Head has now requested you to create a digital form.

This form should have a public URL which can be accessed by anyone. The form should be connected to the **Lead Details** data table.

This form can be provided to leads directly, so they can enter their details directly into the system. The Sales Head is planning to host this form on the webpage of the company website, and other marketing campaign webpages.

This form will help the sales team to:

- Reduce the effort entering lead data into the system
- Increase the reach of the organisation

You are tasked with designing such a form for your organisation.
