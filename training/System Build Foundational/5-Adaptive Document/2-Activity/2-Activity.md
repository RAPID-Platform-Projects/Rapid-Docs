# Activity - Create an Adaptive Document Form 

The Sales Team of Stationary Inc. is happy with the infrastructure you have created for them to record Sales Leads data. The Sales team interacts with every lead and then record their data carefully in the data table. 

However, the Sales Head has now requested you to create a form. This form should have a public url which can be accessed by anyone. The form should be connected to the data table - Lead Details. This form will be provided to the leads directly and they will fill in their details directly to the system. The Sales Head is planning to host this form on the webpage of the company website and other marketing campaign webpages.

This form will help the sales team to :

1. Reduce on the effort of filling the sales leads data into the system
2. Increase the reach of the organisation among interested entities

You are tasked with designing such a form for your organisation. 

**HINT**

1. Create an Adaptive Document form 
2. Create connection of the form with the data table (Lead Details)
3. Add elements to design the Adaptive Document. Add proper static text, input fields from connected table etc.
4. Add a submit button and configure it to the action of submitting form data to the system.  

Below is a sample for Adaptive Document form.
