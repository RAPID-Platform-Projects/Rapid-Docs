# Introduction to Rapid Platform

One can argue that a large part of business management is data management. It allows for efficient storage, organisation, and analysis of data, which can lead to better decision-making, improved productivity, and increased profitability.

Rapid Platform enables organisations to manage their data more efficiently. Using Rapid infrastructure businesses can create their own custom database tables for storage and maintenance of business data. Further, it can integrate with Microsoft Power BI and allow users to create their own reports. These reports help business users to slice, dice and interpret information in a more meaningful manner. So whether a user wants to view sales charts by geography, an employee workload report or project status report with reference to schedule, everything easily possible via Rapid Platform.

Further, one cannot deny that processes are an integral part of every business. Business operations management is synonymous with business process management in many ways. Moreover, business processes are unique to every business, hence a its not a one-size-fits-all solution. 

Rapid Platform provides businesses with the flexibility to easily draw their own business process diagrams which automate business operations. Rapid Platform provides a BPMN 2.0 based business process automation engine which is capable of fetching data from the databases and perform defined actions automatically. 

Finally, how much of business is about team management or people management! One can say a large part of business management is about delegating tasks to team members and monitoring outcomes effectively. 

Rapid Platform offers a Task Experience which allows business managers to assign tasks to their teams and notify team members. Team members can easily manage their tasks and update status, log effort etc. using the Task Experience in Rapid Platform. 

Hence, Rapid Platform allows businesses to effectively manage data, manage operations and manage teams.
